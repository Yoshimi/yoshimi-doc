\section{Banks Collection}
\label{sec:banks_collection}

   In this section, we attempt to collect and summarize all of the existing
   banks for \textsl{Yoshimi} and ZynAddSubFX that we can find.  Many of them
   are supplied by the two projects.

   Between all of the collections, there is a large amount of duplication.
   There is also semi-duplication, with slight variations on the same basic
   instrument.
   Various Linux distributions which package ZynAddSubFX and \textsl{Yoshimi}
   might add some banks to their versions of these packages.
   Thus, there are far more sound settings than we can discuss and categorize.

   One thing we're looking for is a good General MIDI (GM) bank for
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.

\subsection{Yoshimi Banks}
\label{subsec:banks_collection_yoshimi}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} comes with the following banks, which may be found in
   \texttt{/usr/share/yoshimi/banks} as installed by the installer.  In this
   case, it is the Debian installer.

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Arpeggios}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX.
      \item \textbf{Bass}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX.
      \item \textbf{Brass}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX.

      \item \textbf{Choir\_and\_Voice}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX, slightly different bank name.
      \item \textbf{Drums}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX, but with only one drum kit included.

      \item \textbf{The\_Mysterious\_Bank}
         Also in ZynAddSubFX, slightly different bank name.
         ZynAddSubFx has three more mysterious banks (see next section).
      \item \textbf{Will\_Godfrey\_Collection}
      \item \textbf{Will\_Godfrey\_Companion}
   \end{enumber}

\subsection{Additional ZynAddSubFX Banks}
\label{subsec:banks_collection_zynaddsubfx}

   ZynAddSubFX comes with the following banks, which may be found in
   the source code \cite{zynsource} or installation packages of this project.
   ZynAddSubFX has some of the same
   banks (as far as we can tell) as \textsl{Yoshimi}, but with the following
   additions:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Companion}
      \item \textbf{Cormi\_Noise and Cormi\_Sound} \cite{cormi}
      \item \textbf{Laba170bank}
      \item \textbf{olivers-100}
      \item \textbf{the\_mysterious\_bank}
      \item \textbf{the\_mysterious\_bank\_2}
      \item \textbf{the\_mysterious\_bank\_3}
      \item \textbf{the\_mysterious\_bank\_4}
   \end{enumber}

\subsection{Additional Banks}
\label{subsec:banks_collection_additional}

   Here are some additional banks we have found, or have built ourselves.
   It often happens that, later on, a site is no longer available.
   Or we forget from whence we got the banks.
   In these cases, the banks are stored in the \texttt{contrib/banks}
   directory of this project.

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Alex\_J}
         The site seems to be gone/expired. So one will find these in the
         "contrib/banks" directory for safekeeping.
      \item \textbf{Bells}
         We have no idea where we got this one.
         Lost track of that information.
      \item \textbf{C\_Ahlstrom}
         These are mine, but not yet made into a systematic bank.
         They are included with this document.
      \item \textbf{Chromatic Percussion}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{Drums\_DS}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{Electric Piano}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{Flute}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{folderol collection}
         \cite{folderol}, also found at \cite{zyndemos}.
      \item \textbf{Internet Collection}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{Leads}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{Louigi\_Verona\_Workshop}
         The site seems to be gone/expired. So one will find these in the
         "contrib/banks" directory for safekeeping.
      \item \textbf{Misc Keys}
         Not sure where we got this at this time.
      \item \textbf{mmxgn Collection} \cite{mmxgn}

         of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} sounds.
