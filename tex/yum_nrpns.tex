\section{Non-Registered Parameter Numbers}
\label{sec:nrpns}

   This section comes from the source-code documentation file
   \texttt{Zyn nrpn.txt} or the \textsl{ZynAddSubFx}
   online manual \cite{zyndoc} and the \textsl{Using\_NRPNS.txt} document that
   accompanies the \textsl{Yoshimi} source code.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} implements System and Insertion effects control in a
   manner compatible with \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}. As with all
   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s NRPNs, the controls can be sent on any MIDI channel.

\subsection{NRPN / Basics}
\label{subsection:nrpns_midi_nrpn_basics}

   NRPN stands for "Non Registered Parameters Number".
   NRPNs can control all System and Insertion effect parameters.
   Using NRPNs, \textsl{Yoshimi} can now directly set some part values
   regardless of what channel that part is connected to.  For example, one
   may change the reverb time when playing to keyboard, or
   change the flanger's LFO frequency.
%  One can disable the NRPN receiving by deselecting the "NRPN" checkbox
%  from the main window (near "Master Keyshift" counter).
   The controls can be sent on any MIDI channel 
   (the MIDI channels numbers are ignored).

   The parameters are:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{NRPN MSB}
      (coarse) (99 or 0x63) sets the system/insertion effects
      (4 for system effects or 8 for insertion effects).
      We abbreviate this value as \texttt{Nhigh}.
      \item \textbf{NRPN LSB}
      (fine) (98 or 0x62) sets the number of the effect (first
      effect is 0).
      We abbreviate this value as \texttt{Nlow}.
      \item \textbf{Data entry MSB}
      (coarse) (6) sets the parameter number of effect to
      change (see below).
      We abbreviate this value as \texttt{Dhigh}.
      \item \textbf{Data entry LSB}
      (fine) (26) sets the parameter of the effect.
      We abbreviate this value as \texttt{Dlow}.
   \end{itemize}

   One must send NRPN coarse/fine before sending Data entry coarse/fine.  If
   the effect/parameter doesn't exists or is set to none, then the NRPN is
   ignored.

   It's generally advisable to set NRPN MSB before LSB However, once MSB has
   been set one can set a chain of LSBs if they share the same MSB.
   The data CCs associated with these are 6 for MSB and 38 for LSB.
   Only when an NRPN has been established can the data values be entered
   (they will be ignored otherwise).
   If a supported control is identified, these data values will be stored
   locally (if needed) so that other NRPNs can be set.
   Whenever either byte of the NRPN is changed, the data values will be
   cleared (but stored settings will not be affected).
   If either NRPN byte is set to 127, all data values are ignored again.

   In \textsl{Yoshimi} NRPNs are not themselves channel-sensitive, but the
   final results will often be sent to whichever is the current channel.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} also supports the curious 14-bit NRPNs, but this shouldn't
   be noticeable to the user. In order to deal with this, and also some
   variations in the way sequencers present NRPNs generally, if a complete
   NRPN is set
   (i.e. \texttt{Nhigh}, \texttt{Nlow}, \texttt{Dhigh}, \texttt{Dlow}),
   then the data bytes can be in
   either order, but must follow \texttt{Nhigh} and \texttt{Nlow}.

   (In these notes, where practical we also list the 14 bit values in square
   brackets.)

   After this, for running values, once
   \texttt{Dhigh} and \texttt{Dlow} have been set if one
   changes either of these, the other will be assumed.
   For example, starting with \texttt{Dhigh} = 6 and \texttt{Dlow} = 20:

   Change \texttt{Dlow} to 15 and \textsl{Yoshimi} will regard this as a
   command \texttt{Dhigh} 6 + \texttt{Dlow} 16 Alternatively change
   \texttt{Dhigh} to 2 and \textsl{Yoshimi} will regard this as a
   command \texttt{Dhigh} 2 + \texttt{Dlow} 20.
   This can be useful but may have unintended consequences!
   If in doubt change either of the NRPN bytes and both data bytes will be
   cleared.

   Additionally there is 96 for data increment and 97 for decrement.

   Data increment and decrement operation enables one to directly change the
   data LSB by between 0 and 63. To change the MSB add 64 to cover the same
   range. Setting 0 might seem pointless, but it gives an alternative way
   to make an initial setting if one's sequencer doesn't play nice.

   Although data increment and decrement are only active if a valid NRPN has
   been set, they are otherwise quite independent single CCs.  For example:

   \begin{verbatim}
      Start Value       Command value   Result
      ----- -----       --------------  ------
      LSB     5           inc 20      25
      MSB     7           inc 68      11
      LSB     128(off)    inc 1       1
      MSB     126         dec 74      116
      MSB     128(off)    dec 65      127
   \end{verbatim}

   A small example (all values in this example are hex):

   \begin{verbatim}
       B0 63 08 // Select the insertion effects
       B0 62 01 // Select the second effect (remember: the first is 00 and not 01)
       B0 06 00 // Select the effect parameter 00
       B0 26 7F // Change the parameter of effect to the value 7F (127)
   \end{verbatim}

   \textbf{WARNING}:
   Changing of some of the effect parameters produces clicks when sounds
   passes thru these effects.  We advise one to change only when the sound
   volume that passes through the effect is very low (or silence).  Some
   parameters produce clicks when they are changed rapidly.

   Here are the effects parameter numbers (for Data entry, coarse).
   The parameters that produces clicks are written in \textcolor{red}{red}
   and have (AC) after their entry (always clicks).
   The parameter that produces clicks only when they are changed fast are
   written in \textcolor{blue}{blue} and have a (FC) after the entry (Fast
   Clicks).
   Most parameters have the range from 0 to 127.
   When parameters have another range, it is written as "(low...high)".

   Here are the basic formats:

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Send NRPN: 
      \begin{itemize}
         \item MSB = 64 (same as for vectors)
         \item LSB = 0
      \end{itemize}
      \item Send Data MSB (6); all value ranges start from zero, not 1.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item 0 : data LSB = part number
         \item 1 : data LSB = program number
         \item 2 : data LSB = controller number
         \item 3 : data LSB = controller value
         \item 4 : data LSB = part's channel number (15 to 127 disconnects
            the part from any channel)
         \item 5 : data LSB = part's audio destination, one of
                    1 = main L\&R;
                    2 = direct L\&R;
                    3 = both;
                    all other values are ignored
         \item 7 : data LSB = main volume (not yet implemented)
         \item 35 (0x23) : data LSB = controller LSB value (not yet implemented)
         \item 39 (0x27) : data LSB = main volume LSB (not yet implemented)
         \item Other values are currently ignored.
      \end{itemize}
   \end{enumerate}

   Other values are currently ignored by \textsl{Yoshimi}.

\paragraph{EQ}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{blue}{00 - Gain (FC)}
   \end{itemize}

   All other settings of the EQ are shown in a different way.
   The N represent the band ("B." setting in the UI) and the first band is 0
   (and not 1), like it is shown in the UI.
   Change the "N" with the band one likes.
   If one wants to change a band that doesn't exist, the NRPN will be ignored.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{red}{10+N*5 - Change the mode of the filter (0..9) (AC)}
      \item 11+N*5 - Band's filter frequency
      \item 12+N*5 - Band's filter gain
      \item 13+N*5 - Band's filter Q (bandwidth or resonance)
      \item \textcolor{magenta}{14+N*5 - reserved}
   \end{itemize}

   Example of setting the gain on the second band in the EQ module:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item The bands start counting from 0, so the second band is
         1 =\textless N=1.
      \item The formula is 12+N*5 =\textless 12+1*5=17, so the number of effect
         parameter (for Data entry coarse) is 17.
   \end{itemize}

\paragraph{DynFilter}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item 0 - Volume
      \item 1 - Pan
      \item 2 - LFO Frequency
      \item 3 - LFO Randomness
      \item 4 - LFO Type
      \item 5 - LFO Stereo Difference
      \item 6 - LFO Depth
      \item 7 - Filter Amplitude
      \item 8 - Fitler Amplitude Rate Change
      \item 9 - Invert the signal (negate) (0..1)
   \end{itemize}

   Click behaviour of DynFilter has not yet been tested.

\paragraph{Yoshimi Extensions}

   If the Data MSB bit 6 is set (64) then Data LSB sets the effect type
   instead of a parameter number.  This must be set before making a parameter
   change.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item 0 - Reverb
      \item 1 - Echo
      \item 2 - Chorus
      \item 3 - Phaser
      \item 4 - AlienWah
      \item 5 - Distortion
      \item 6 - EQ
      \item 7 - DynFilter
   \end{itemize}

   For Insert effects, if the Data MSB bit 5 is set (32) then Data LSB sets
   the destination part number. 127 is off and 126 is the Master Output.
   A complete example:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item 99 -   8 \textasciitilde insert effects
      \item 98 -   3 \textasciitilde number 4 (as displayed)
      \item 6 -  32 \textasciitilde set destination
      \item 38 - 126 \textasciitilde Master Out
      \item 99 -   8  *
      \item 98 -   3  *
      \item 6 -  64 \textasciitilde change effect
      \item 38 -   4 \textasciitilde Alienwah
      \item 99 -   8  *
      \item 98 -   3  *
      \item 6 -   0 \textasciitilde Dry/Wet
      \item 38 -  30 \textasciitilde value
   \end{itemize}

   Notes (*): these repeats are not needed as far as \textsl{Yoshimi}
   is concerned, but some sequencers get unhappy without them.
   Change just a parameter on an exisiting system effect:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item 99 -   4 \textasciitilde system effects
      \item 98 -   0 \textasciitilde the first effect
      \item 6 -   1 \textasciitilde Pan
      \item 38 -  75 \textasciitilde value
   \end{itemize}

\subsection{NRPN / Dynamic System Settings}
\label{subsection:nrpns_dynamic_system_settings}

   Almost all dynamic setup (i.e. that doesn't require a restart) can now be
   done via NRPNs, so a MIDI file can manage \textsl{Yoshimi} starting from a
   pretty random state, and set up important features like Bank and Program
   change behavior and the number of available parts.

   In parallel with this setup, there is a command to list all of these
   settings. One can also list the available bank roots, the banks in any
   root, and instruments in any bank, along with their numeric IDs. These IDs
   can then be used with normal MIDI CCs to get exactly the instrument you
   want at any time.

   This arrangment looks positively steam-punk, but is actually very easy to
   use, requiring only a command line interface and any utility that can send
   MIDI CCs. NRPNs aren't special. They are simply a specific pattern of CCs.
   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s implementation is very forgiving, doesn't mind if you
   stop halfway through (will just get on with other things while it waits),
   and will report exactly what it is doing.  So ...

   ... If \textsl{Yoshimi} has been started from the command line (but not
   necessarily in the no-GUI mode), all of the system settings that don't
   require a restart can now be viewed by sending the appropriate NRPN. Most
   of them can also be changed in this way.

   To access this functionality, set NRPN MSB (CC 99) to 64 and NRPN LSB (CC
   98) to 2 (8130).

   After that send the following DATA values. Commands with LSB x don't
   actually use DATA LSB, but one still needs to send it (unless it has
   already been set by a previous command in this control group).
