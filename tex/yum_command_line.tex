\section{The Yoshimi Command Line Interface 1.3.6M}
\label{sec:command_line}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} provides a "no GUI" or "command-line" mode of operation
   where some aspects of the application can be controlled via textual commands.
   This mode is useful for blind people, for example.

   One of the main features of the 1.3.6 release is improved non-GUI
   accessibility.  This feature focusses on using two universally available
   techniques. The effectiveness (and indeed usefulness) of this feature
   will help shape future complementary interfaces. Also, a number of
   first-time defaults have been changed to make this feataure easier.

   When starting from the command line, an argument can be included for a new
   root path to be defined to point to a set of banks fetched from elsewhere.
   This will be given the next free ID. A future upgrade will allow the ID to
   be set to any valid one when it is created, mirroring the GUI behaviour.

   Additional controls that are frequently taken for granted in the GUI, but
   otherwise get forgotten, are \textsl{master key shift}
   and \textsl{master volume}.

   The command-line mode provides extensive error checking and feedback.
   Note the change in nomenclature from "Parameters" to "Patch Set", which is
   visible in the main screen, and also reflected in the command line.

\subsection{Command Table}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_table}

   When running from the command line, these commands
   (see \tableref{table:yoshimi_text_commands})
   can be entered after the 'up and running' message.
   The commands are not case-sensitive.

   The brief descriptions in the following table can be obtained
   using the "help" command in the \textsl{Yoshimi} command-line mode.
   More detailed descriptions are given in the section following the table.

   Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will print a reminder.
   usually, one only needs the first 3 letters of the names, provided that is
   unambiguous.

   Commands with '*' in the description need the setup to be saved, and Yoshimi
   restarted to be activated. 

   More commands will be added, and the organisation of the commands
   may change slightly.
