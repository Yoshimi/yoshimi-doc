\section{The Yoshimi Command Line Interface 1.3.6M}
\label{sec:command_line}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} provides a "no GUI" or "command-line" mode of operation
   where some aspects of the application can be controlled via textual commands.
   This mode is useful for blind people, for example.  To access this mode, add
   the \texttt{-i} or \texttt{--no-gui} command-line option when starting
   \textsl{Yoshimi} on the command-line.  But note that, when starting
   \textsl{Yoshimi} on the command-line, the "command-line" mode of operation is
   available at the same time as the GUI.

   One of the main features of the 1.3.6 release is improved non-GUI
   accessibility.  In a command line environment, almost all the 'running'
   commands are available, but none of the instrument editing ones are... yet!
   One can decide what MIDI/audio setup is wanted, list and set roots and banks,
   load instruments into any part, change a part's channel, set main volume and
   key shift, and set up vector control.  A number of first-time defaults have
   been changed to make this feataure easier.

   When starting from the command line, an argument can be included for a new
   root path to be defined to point to a set of banks fetched from elsewhere.
   This will be given the next free ID. A future upgrade will allow the ID to
   be set to any valid one when it is created, mirroring the GUI behaviour.

   Once running, almost all dynamic setup (i.e. doesn't require a restart) can now
   be done within the terminal window. There is also extensive control of roots,
   banks, parts and instruments including the ability to list and set all of
   these. One can now do things like:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> path add /home/music/yoshimi/banks
      yoshimi> set part 4 program 130
   \end{verbatim}

   Additional controls that are frequently taken for granted in the GUI, but
   otherwise get forgotten, are \textsl{master key shift} and \textsl{master
   volume}.  The most important parts of vector control are exposed to the
   command line.

   The command-line mode provides extensive error checking and feedback.
   Note the change in nomenclature from "Parameters" to "Patch Set", which is
   visible in the main screen, and also reflected in the command line.

   Here is an example startup session, using ALSA for audio and MIDI support:

   \begin{verbatim}
      Yoshimi is starting
      March little endian = 1
      Format = Signed Little Endian 32 Bit 2 Channel
      Didn't find alsa MIDI source 'default'
      Yoshimi 1.3.6 M
      Clientname: yoshimi
      Config: Audio: alsa -> 'default'
      Midi: alsa -> 'default'
      Oscilsize: 1024
      Samplerate: 48000
      Period size: 1024

      Yay! We're up and running :-)
      yoshimi> 
   \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Command Table}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_table}

   When running from the command line, these commands
   (see \tableref{table:yoshimi_text_commands})
   can be entered after the 'up and running' message.
   The commands are not case-sensitive.
   The commands can be abbreviated to the first three letters of each command.

   The brief descriptions in the following table can be obtained
   using the "help" command in the \textsl{Yoshimi} command-line mode.
   More detailed descriptions are given in the section following the table.

   Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will print a reminder.
   usually, one only needs the first 3 letters of the names, provided that is
   unambiguous.

   Commands with '*' in the description need the setup to be saved, and Yoshimi
   restarted to be activated. 

   More commands will be added, and the organisation of the commands
   may change slightly.

\subsection{Command Descriptions}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_descriptions}

   This section describes the command-line commands in more detail.

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{load patchset [s]}{cmd!load patchset}
      Loads a complete patch set from the named file.

   \itempar{save patchset [s]}{cmd!save patchset}
      Saves the patch set to the named file.

   \itempar{save setup}{cmd!save setup}
      Saves the current dynamic system settings.

   \itempar{paths}{cmd!paths}
      Displays all the currently defined bank root paths and their IDs.

   \itempar{path add [s]}{cmd!path add}
      Defines a new bank root path and returns its ID.
      Example: \texttt{path add /home/music/yoshimi/banks}

   \itempar{path remove [n]}{cmd!path remove}
      Removes the path-entry ID \textsl{n} from the bank roots. 
      It does not delete anything.

   \itempar{list banks [n]}{cmd!list banks}
      Lists all the instruments and their IDs in bank \textsl{n} (or the
      current bank) of the current root.

   \itempar{list instruments [n]}{cmd!list instruments}
      Lists all the instruments and their IDs in bank \textsl{n}
      (or the current bank) of the current root.

   \itempar{list current}{cmd!list current}
      Lists the number of parts available and parts with instruments
      currently installed along with any enabled with the default sound.
      Also shows their audio destination:
      \textsl{M} = main L/R, \textsl{P} = part L/R, \textsl{B} = both, and
      \textsl{-} = disabled or unavailable.
      This way one can tell if an instrument patch is installed even if it is
      not currently usable.
      To avoid unnecessary list length, the default "Simple Sound" is not shown
      unless it is enabled.

   \itempar{list setup}{cmd!list setup}
      Displays the current dynamic system settings.

   \itempar{list vector [n]}{cmd!list vector}
      Lists the settings for vector on channel \textsl{n}.

      Set report destination (1 = GUI, anything else sets stderr).

   \itempar{set root [n]}{cmd!set root}
      Set current root path to ID \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{set bank [n]}{cmd!set bank}
      Set current bank to ID \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{set part [n1] program [n2]}{cmd!set part program}
      Load instrument \textsl{n2} into part \textsl{n1}.
      Example: \texttt{set part 4 program 130}

   \itempar{set part [n1] channel [n2]}{cmd!set part channel}
      Set the MIDI channel \textsl{n2} for part \textsl{n1}.
      If the channel number is greater than 15, no further MIDI
      messages will be accepted by that part.

   \itempar{set part [n1] destination [n2]}{cmd!set part destination}
      Set the audio destination of part \textsl{n1}
      to main (\textsl{1}), part (\textsl{2}), both (\textsl{3}).
      Also enables the part if not already enabled.

   \itempar{set ccroot [n]}{cmd!set ccroot}
      Set the MIDI CC for root path changes (128 disables).

   \itempar{set ccbank [n]}{cmd!set ccbank}
      Set the MIDI CC for bank changes (anything other than 0 or 32
      disables it).

   \itempar{set program [n]}{cmd!set program}
      Set MIDI program change (0 disables, anything else enables).

   \itempar{set activate [n]}{cmd!set activate}
      Set part-activate on program change (\textsl{n} = 0 disables
      part activation, anything else enables it). This features
      applies to command line program change as well.

   \itempar{set extend [n]}{cmd!set extend}
      Set the CC value for extended program change (anything greater
      than 119 disables it).

   \itempar{set available [n]}{cmd!set available}
      Set the number of available parts (16, 32, 64).

   \itempar{set volume [n]}{cmd!set volume}
      Set the master volume.

   \itempar{set shift [n]}{cmd!set shift}
      Set the master key shift for following notes in semitones (+-
      octave, 64 for no shift).

   \itempar{set alsa midi [s]}{cmd!set alsa midi}
      * Sets the name of the MIDI device ALSA looks for.

   \itempar{set alsa audio [s]}{cmd!set alsa audio}
      * Sets the name of the audio hardware device ALSA looks for.

   \itempar{set jack server [s]}{cmd!set jack server}
      * Sets the name of the JACK server Yoshimi tries to connect to.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y cc [n2]}{cmd!set vector cc}
      CC \textsl{n2} is used for channel \textsl{n1} X or Y axis sweep.
      For X, this also enables vector control for the channel.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y features [n2]}{cmd!set vector features}
      Sets channel \textsl{n1} X or Y features to \textsl{n2}.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y program [l/r] [n2]}{cmd!set vector program}
      Loads program \textsl{n2} to channel \textsl{n1} X or Y
      \textsl{left} or \textsl{right} part.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y control [n2] [n3]}{cmd!set vector control}
      Sets \texttt{n3} CC to use for X or Y feature \texttt{n2} (2, 4, 8).
      \textsl{n3} is the CC to be used for feature number \textsl{n2} on X
      vector channel \textsl{n1}. The \textsl{x} is a sort of hidden parameter
      as the code uses an offset dependent on whether it is \textsl{x} or
      \textsl{y}. Also \textsl{n1} can be omitted in which case it will use the
      last defined channel number. Using alternate words and numbers gives a
      great deal of flexibility like this.

   \itempar{set vector [n] [off]}{cmd!set vector}
      Disables vector control for channel \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{stop}{cmd!stop}
      Cease all sound immediately!

   \itempar{mode [s]}{cmd!mode}
      Change to different menus: addsynth, subsynth, or padsynth.

   \itempar{? or help}{cmd!help}
      List commands for current mode.

   \itempar{exit}{cmd!exit}
         Tidy up and close Yoshimi down.
