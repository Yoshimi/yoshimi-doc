\section{Yoshimi Man Page}
\label{sec:yoshimi_man_page}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} man page is actually the output of the
   \texttt{yoshimi --help} command, which prints out the command-line that
   are discussed in this section.

  \optionpar{-a}{--alsa-midi[="device"]}
      Use ALSA MIDI input.
      From the command line, as well as autoconnecting the main L \& R
      outputs to JACK, with ALSA MIDI one can now auto-connect to a known source.

   \begin{verbatim}
      ./yoshimi -K --alsa-midi="Virtual Keyboard"
   \end{verbatim}

      ALSA can often manage with just the client name.  This command is case
      sensitive, and quite fussy about spaces, etc., so it's wise to use
      quotes for the source name, even if they don't seem to be needed.

  \optionpar{-A}{--alsa-audio[=device]}
      Use ALSA audio output.

  \optionpar{-b}{--buffersize=size}
      Set ALSA internal audio buffer size.

  \optionpar{-c}{--show-console}
      Show the console on startup.

  \optionpar{-D}{--define-root}
      Define the path to a new bank root.
      \textsl{Yoshimi} will then immediately scan this path for new banks,
      but won't make the root (or any of its banks) current. The final
      directory doesn't in fact have to be 'banks' but traditionally
      \textsl{Yoshimi} has always done this.
      Also, when running from the command line there is now access to many of
      the system, root, bank, etc. settings.
      See \sectionref{sec:command_line}.

  \optionpar{-i}{--no-gui}
      Do not show the GUI.  See \sectionref{sec:command_line} for more
      information about this mode of operation.  Note that the command and the
      GUI can be available simultaneously.

  \optionpar{-j}{--jack-midi[=device]} 
      Use JACK MIDI input.
      From the command line, as well as autoconnecting the main L \& R
      outputs to JACK, with JACK MIDI one can now auto-connect to a known source.

   \begin{verbatim}
      ./yoshimi -K --jack-midi="jack-keyboard:midi_out"
   \end{verbatim}
   
   JACK needs the port as well as the name.
   This command is case sensitive, and quite fussy about spaces, etc.,
   so it's wise to use quotes for the source name, even if they don't seem to
   be needed.

  \optionpar{-J}{--jack-audio[=server]}
      Use JACK audio output.
      Connect to the given JACK server if given.

  \optionpar{-k}{--autostart-jack}
      Auto-start the JACK server.

  \optionpar{-K}{--auto-connect}
      Auto-connect JACK audio.

  \optionpar{-l}{--load=file}
      Load a \texttt{.xmz} file.

  \optionpar{-L}{--load-instrument=file}
      Load an \texttt{.xiz} file

  \optionpar{-N}{--name-tag=tag}
      Add tag to client-name.

  \optionpar{-o}{--oscilsize=size}
      Set ADDSynth oscillator size (OscilSize).

  \optionpar{-R}{--samplerate=rate}
      Set ALSA audio sample rate.

  \optionpar{-S}{--state[=file]}
      Load saved state from file, where the file defaults to
      \texttt{\$HOME/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.state}

  \optionpar{-u}{--jack-session-file[=file]}
      Load the named JACK session file.

  \optionpar{-U}{--jack-session-uuid[=uuid]}
      Load the named JACK session by UUID.

  \optionpar{-?}{--help}
      Give this help list.

   \optionpar{--usage}
      Provide a short usage message.

  \optionpar{-V}{--version}
      Print program version.

   Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
   optional for any corresponding short options.

   From the command line, as well as autoconnecting the main L \& R outputs
   to JACK, with either JACK or ALSA MIDI one can now auto-connect to a
   known source.

   ALSA can often manage with just the client name, but JACK needs the port
   as well. These commands are case sensitive, and quite fussy about spaces
   etc. so it's wise to use quotes for the source name, even if they don't
   seem to be needed.
