\section{Menu}
\label{sec:menu}

   We're now ready to describe the user-interface of \textsl{Yoshimi}!
   The \textsl{Yoshimi} menu, as seen at the top of
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen},
   is fairly simple, but it is important to understand the
   structure of the menu entries.

\subsection{Menu / Yoshimi}
\label{subsec:menu_yoshimi}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi}
   menu entry contains the sub-items shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_menu_items}.
   \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=1]{1.5.11/Menu.png}
   \caption[Yoshimi Menu, Exit]{Yoshimi Menu}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_menu_items}
\end{figure}
   The next few sub-sections discuss the sub-items in the
   \textsl{Yoshimi} sub-menu.
   (Note that, in \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}, this menu is called the
   \textsl{File} menu.)

%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.5.3/yoshimi-menu-yoshimi.png}
%  \caption{Yoshimi Menu Items}
%  \label{fig:yoshimi_menu_items}
% \end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.6.0/view_yoshimi.png}
   \caption[Yoshimi Menu, Exit]{Yoshimi Menu}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_view_yoshimi}
\end{figure}

   The items it contains are:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{About...}
      \item \textbf{New instance}
      \item \textbf{Settings...}
      \item \textbf{Reports...}
      \item \textbf{View Manual...}
      \item \textbf{Exit}
   \end{enumber}

   \index{new!vectors}
   The \textbf{Vectors} menu entry of version 1.4.0 has been moved to its own
   button in version 1.4.1, as can be seen in the figure.  See
   \sectionref{subsec:vector_dialogs}, which presents this dialog and
   describes it.

   \index{new!Reports}
   \textbf{Reports} This opens the \textsl{Yoshimi} console window.
   It has been swapped with MIDI-learn, which now has the button on the main window.
   Note that this will only show any messages if reports are not going to
   \texttt{stdout}. This can be changed by setting \textbf{Yoshimi / Settings
   / Main Settings / Send reports to:} to \textsl{Console Window}
   (for this item see
   \sectionref{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_main_settings}.)

% Now fixed!
%
%  \textbf{Bug:}
%  \index{bugs!menu hot keys don't work}
%  There seems to be a bug in that the expected menu hot-keys
%  (Alt-Y, Alt-I, Alt-P, and Alt-S) do not work (Yoshimi 1.3.5).

   \index{new!View Manual}
   \textbf{View Manual} This currently requires that a PDF viewer
   be installed.
   Note that some viewers might not work properly
   (e.g. \texttt{apvlv} (\cite{apvlv}).

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / About...}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_about}

   There is no \textbf{Help} menu in \textsl{Yoshimi}.  Therefore, the
   \textbf{About} dialog appears in the \textbf{Yoshimi} menu, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_about_dialog}.
   These guys need some acknowledgment for their hard work!
   And they acknowledge the massive groundwork laid by the
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} project.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{menu/Yoshimi/yoshimi-about.jpg}
%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.3.8/yoshimi-about.jpg}

   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.6.0/About.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Menu, About Dialog}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_about_dialog}
\end{figure}
    This has a new 'more' button that changes the window to an alphabetic list of
    all those who have helped Yoshimi. Sometimes just a hint from these friends
    has been enough to pave the way for extensive improvements.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.5.9/Contributors.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Menu, Contributors}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_contributors}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / New instance}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_new_instance}

   The \textbf{New instance} menu entry creates a new instance of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  If JACK is running, start a normal (JACK-using) instance
   of \textsl{Yoshimi}.  Then use this menu entry.  \textsl{Yoshimi} will start
   another instance of itself, with a prompt to accept the next available
   instance ID or to change it.  The presence of this instance can be verified
   by running a JACK session manager such as \textsl{QJackCtl}.
   In a non-JACK setup it won't fail, but in the absence of any specific
   setting, it will have null audio, but (probably) will still connect to ALSA
   MIDI.  Not too useful, but we should test that sometime.

   It is important to note that each instance of \textsl{Yoshimi} has its
   own configuration file.  Each also has its own MIDI and audio ports.
   Thus, these instances are partly independent of each other.
   The new instance tries to open a \textsl{Yoshimi} instance based on the
   configuration found in the file
   \texttt{\textasciitilde/.config/\-yoshimi/\-yoshimi.configXX}, where
   \textsl{XX} is the ID one supplied.

   Opening a new instance creates a copy that has it's own dynamic memory for
   running storage. Some data (such as recent history) is shared between
   instances. This is done only where instances actually need to be in sync.
   The bank structure is partially synchronised, but needs more work.

%  Each instance has it's own file-store in \textsl{Yoshimi}'s configuration
%  directory. The means that if one opens a numbered instance, one will get
%  back all the settings that were previously used for that instance.

   Instances no longer fight for access to JACK/ALSA audio; they simply
   try to find another route to a soundcard. Failing to find one,
   they revert to null audio, but nonetheless start cleanly.

   The list of hidden "base parameters" that are set only by the main instance
   is now:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item ALSA Sample Rate
      \item Internal Buffer Size
      \item AddSynth Oscillator Size
      \item XML Compression Level
      \item Show Splash Screen
      \item Enable GUI
      \item Enable CLI
   \end{itemize}

   In the other instances these are now hidden instead of deactivated.  This
   behavior makes sense, as they are \textsl{never} enabled in the other
   instances of \textsl{Yoshimi}. This is more consistent, making
   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s configuration directory more tidy.

\iffalse

%  SECTION COMMENTED OUT

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / New instance with id...}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_new_instance_with_id}

   Creates a new instance of \textsl{Yoshimi}
   with an ID that is a number.
   See \figureref{fig:yoshimi_instance_dialog}.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{menu/Yoshimi/yoshimi-instance-id.jpg}
   \caption{Yoshimi Menu, Instance Dialog}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_instance_dialog}
\end{figure}

   Useful when connecting devices with JACK.
   Start a normal (JACK-using) instance of \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   Then use this menu entry, supply a number as an ID.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} will start another instance
   of itself, with an ID of whatever number one specified.
   This instance can be verified by running a JACK session manager such as
   \textsl{QJackCtl}.

\fi

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings...}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_settings}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi Settings} dialog contains five tabs that control the
   major and overall settings of \textsl{Yoshimi}.  At the bottom of this
   dialog are two buttons:
   \textbf{Save and Close} and \textbf{Close Unsaved}.
   \index{Save and Close}
   \index{Close Unsaved}

   Please note that the \textbf{Save and Close} and \textbf{Close Unsaved}
   buttons apply to the \textsl{whole}
   \textbf{Settings} window.
   Furthermore, the "saving" does \textsl{not} refer to preserving the changes
   that have been made
   in any of the tabs for the current \textsl{Yoshimi} session.  Any changes
   made in \textbf{Settings} always remain in place for the current
   \textsl{Yoshimi} session.
   However, the changes to the settings are saved to
   the state file \textsl{only} if \textbf{Save and Close} is clicked.

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Save and Close}{Settings!Save and Close}
   This selection saves the settings made in \textbf{all} of the tabs to the
   state file, and closes the \textsl{Yoshimi} settings dialog.

   \itempar{Close Unsaved}{Settings!Close Unsaved}
   Close Unsaved, Main Settings.

   This selection closes the \textsl{Yoshimi} settings dialog.
   However, note that any changes made in the tabs
   \textsl{are preserved}.  They are preserved for the current
   \textsl{Yoshimi} session, but are not saved to the filesystem.

   Here are the tabs included in the main settings of \textsl{Yoshimi}
   as of version 1.4.1; each is described in its own section.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Main settings}
      \item \textbf{Switches}
      \item \textbf{Jack}
      \item \textbf{Alsa}
      \item \textbf{MIDI}
   \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / Main Settings}
\label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_main_settings}

   The Main Settings tab controls the main configuration items that
   follow, which apply to all patches/instruments.
   The main settings are shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_settings_tab}.
   Some settings only take effect after restarting the synthesizer.
   In \textbf{Main settings}, only the items marked with an asterisk ('*')
   need a restart.
   The settings dialogs have changed gradually as
   \textsl{Yoshimi} has progressed.

\begin{figure}[H]

   \label{fig:yoshimi_main_settings_tab}
\end{figure}

   The following settings exist in the \textsl{Main settings} tab:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{AddSynth Oscillator Size}
      \item \textbf{Internal Buffer Size}
      \item \textbf{PADsynth interpolation}
      \item \textbf{Virtual Keyboard Layout}
      \item \textbf{XML compression level}
      \item \textbf{Send reports to}
      \item \textbf{Saved instrument Format}
   \end{enumber}

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{AddSynth Oscillator Size}{Main Settings!oscillator size}
   ADDsynth Oscillator Size (in samples).  This item used to be called
   "OscilSize".  Sets the number of the points of the ADDsynth oscillator.
   Bigger is better, as it results in a more mathematically-correct waveform,
   but it takes more CPU, though it has no effect on latency.
   In an all-JACK environment, JACK determines the latency.  There are very few
   occasions where one might want the internal buffer smaller than the JACK
   size, and none where it should be bigger. If it is bigger, the extra space
   will (to a small degree) represent wasted memory and processor use.

% This link fails for some reason.
   See \sectionref{sec:resource_usage_buffer_sizes}, which
   goes into performance-related details.

   The default value for \textsl{Yoshimi} is shown marked with an asterisk.
   \index{asterisk}
   \index{default!asterisk}
   This asterisk/plus-sign convention is used throughout this manual.
   See \figureref{fig:yoshimi_oscilsize_values},
   shown below for the AddSynth Oscillator Size drop-down element.

   Values: \texttt{256, 512*, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{menu/Yoshimi/main-oscilsize.jpg}
   \caption[OscilSize Values]{AddSynth Oscillator Size (samples)}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_oscilsize_values}
\end{figure}

   \itempar{Internal Buffer Size}{Main Settings!buffer size}
   This item was updated with version 1.3.6.  It is actually the old
   \textbf{Period Size} field from the \textbf{Alsa} tab.
   It sets the granularity of the sound generation.
   To find out the internal delay in milliseconds, divide the
   buffer-size value by the sample-rate, then multiply the result by 1000:
   For example, \(256 / 44100 * 1000 = 5.8 ms\).

   The default internal buffer size has been reduced from 1024 to 256.  One
   gets better latency that way.  Almost all modern computers can run
   \textsl{Yoshimi} with the current default (smaller) buffer-size value, and
   many will do so at 64 frames (and even 16 frames!)
   without any special precautions.

   Note that, for ALSA, if the audio destination is "default",
   then ALSA decides on the buffer size (among other settings), and
   \textsl{Yoshimi} will set it's internal buffer size to match,
   which always seems to be 1024.

   Values: \texttt{64, 128, 256*, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}

\begin{figure}[H]

   \label{fig:yoshimi_internalsize_values}
\end{figure}

   Note that there are two more values, not shown in this old diagram.

   \itempar{PADsynth interpolation}{Main Settings!PADsynth Interpolation}
   See \figureref{fig:padsynth_interpolation}, shown below,
   for the interpolation values.
   From an email conversation with Paul Nasca, Will notes that
   the sound improvement with cubic interpolation is quite subtle, and requires
   a well designed audio setup, a PADsynth instrument with a fair amount of
   high-frequency content... and good hearing!

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{menu/Yoshimi/main-padsynth-interpolation.jpg}
   \caption[PADSynth Interpolation]{PADSynth Interpolation Values}
   \label{fig:padsynth_interpolation}
\end{figure}

   Values: \texttt{Linear(fast)*, Cubic(slow)}

   \itempar{Virtual Keyboard Layout}{Main Settings!Virtual Keyboard Layout}
   The virtual keyboard is useful, but it is difficult to move the mouse
   rapidly to the next key on the virtual keyboard.
   Therefore, \textsl{Yoshimi} supports using the computer keyboard
   to produce notes.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{top-panel/ascii-virtual-keyboard.png}
   \caption{QWERTY Virtual Keyboard Layout}
   \label{fig:qwerty_virtual_keyboard}
\end{figure}

   See \figref{fig:qwerty_virtual_keyboard},
   for the mapping of the computer keyboard to the
   virtual keyboard.
   Three octaves (blue, green, and red) are available, with the dark keys of
   each color representing the "black" keys.
   Note that this is a QWERTY layout.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} also supports other keyboard layouts.
   See \figureref{fig:virtual_kbd_layout},
   for the virtual keyboard layout settings drop-down.

   Values: \texttt{QWERTY*, Dvorak, QWERTZ, AZERTY}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{menu/Yoshimi/main-virtual-kbd-layout.jpg}
   \caption[Virtual Keyboard Layout]{Virtual Keyboard Layout Values}
   \label{fig:virtual_kbd_layout}
\end{figure}

   \itempar{XML compression level}{Main Settings!XML compression level}
   Gzip Compression level of \textsl{Yoshimi} XML files.
   The settings and instruments of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}
   are preserved in XML files.
   The value of 0 indicates that the XML file is uncompressed.

   In general, 0 is a setting for debugging only.  Setting this
   option makes the XML files a bit larger, perhaps larger by a factor of more
   than 10, making a 10K file into a 180K file.  For a little "wasted" space
   and time, one can view the XML file in a text editor.  If
   one's system is tight on disk space, higher levels of compression can be
   specified.  Using XML compression can also save file access time which may
   be beneficial if one's computer is borderline on latency.  This setting
   should stay at 3 if one is going make instruments publicly available, as
   some older versions of Yoshimi and ZynAddSubFX don't recognise uncompressed
   files. This also applies if one is going to save large patchsets that will
   be loaded while running. Uncompressing is \textsl{much} faster than file
   loading.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 9, 3*}

   \itempar{Send reports to}{Main Settings!Send Reports Destination}
   Notices and error messages can be sent to the standard error log of
   the terminal in which
   \textsl{Yoshimi} can be run, or, more usefully, to
   an output console window.
   In some versions of Yoshimi these messages were pushed in reverse order, to
   avoid manually scrolling and to make the most recent statuses easily visible.
   However, a method has now been found to auto-scroll and keep the most recent
   entry visible, so new entries are in normal reading order.

   See \figureref{fig:send_reports_to}.
   It provides a depiction of the selection drop-down.

   Values: \texttt{stderr*, Console Window}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{menu/Yoshimi/main-send-reports-to.jpg}
   \caption[Send Reports]{Send Reports To}
   \label{fig:send_reports_to}
\end{figure}

   If the \textbf{Console Window} option is chosen, then the
   \textbf{Reports} button in the effects panel is enabled.
   Pressing the \textbf{Reports} button brings up a small console dialog, as
   shown in \figureref{fig:console_window}.

\begin{figure}[H]

   \caption[Yoshimi Console Window]{Console Window}
   \label{fig:console_window}
\end{figure}

   Note that numbers that are shown (such as part numbers) all start from 1,
   not 0.

   \begin{verbatim}
		Loaded 65 "Hyper Arpeggio" to Part 1
		Loaded 10 "Arpeggio11" to Part 2
		Loaded 41 "Soft Arpeggio4" to Part 3
		Loaded 67 "Glass Arpeggio1" to Part 4
   \end{verbatim}

   % VVV not since V 1.5.6!
%   \index{reports!middle-click}
%   An interesting feature of the console window is that one can identify
%   user-interface elements of the \textsl{Yoshimi} configuration in this window
%   by a middle-click on the user-interface element.
%   (Unfortunately, those new single-button touchpads make it impossible to
%   provide a middle-click, so one would need a mouse!)

%  The console window figure shows the results of middle-clicking on the
%  following bottom-panel knobs in order:

%  \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Velocity Sense (left-click)
%     \item Velocity Offset
%     \item Pan
%     \item Volume
%  \end{enumerate}

%   \index{reports!middle-click}
%   Information about each knob middle-clicked is pushed to the top of the
%   windows in reverse order.
%   \index{reports!left-click}
%   \index{reports!right-click}
%   Information about an earlier left-click is shown at the bottom of the figure.
%%   Each left-click ("Button 1") will increase the parameter represented by the
%   knob, and each right-click ("Button3") will decrease the parameter
%   represented by the knob, and each change is reported in the console window.
%   And, of course, each middle-click changes nothing, but reports the current
%   value in the console window.
%   This feature lets one gather the information needed to
%   control the parameter from the command-line.
%   The output can be selected, copied, and pasted to a script or archive text
%   file for safe-keeping.

   \itempar{Saved instrument Format}{Main Settings!instrument file format}
   This new (1.5.5) feature provides a choice between the old instrument format
   and a new format.
   The \textbf{Legacy} format has a file extension \texttt{.xiz}.
   The \textbf{Yoshimi} format has a file extension \texttt{.xiy}.

   Values: \texttt{Legacy (.xiz), Yoshimi (.xiy), Both (.xiz + .xiy)}

	Some users wanted a way to store the \textbf{Controllers} settings
   with an instrument, as they can make a dramatic difference to the
   sound. There is now a superset of instruments that can be saved instead of,
   or as well as, the standard ones. On loading, \textsl{Yoshimi}
   will look for the extended version (\texttt{.xiy}) first.
   This applies to instruments in banks, as well as
   externally saved instrument.
   If one has an extended type loaded, the instrument
   name will be in a blue font, instead of black.
   This also applies to the stored instruments in bank slots.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.5.5/MainYoshiType-font.png}
   \caption[Yoshimi Font for Extended File Format]{Extended File Format Font}
   \label{fig:extended_file_format_font}
\end{figure}

   This is part of the rationale of the new instrument format: We will
   \textsl{never} make any changes to the standard instruments, and one will always
   be able to load and save them. However, we will incrementally add improvements
   and refinements to the new format, with compatible
   adjustments for the standard-format instruments, where appropriate.

   There is a caveat when handling instruments in banks. If one sets for only
   \textbf{Legacy} or only \textbf{Yoshimi}, but have previously set for both,
   saving to such a dual entry will erase the one that wasn't selected. Currently,
   it is not known why that happens (banks are 'interesting').

\paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / Switches}
\label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_switches}

   Many of the check-box items have been moved into this new tab, to reduce
   clutter.

\begin{figure}[H]

%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.4.1/SettingsSwitches.png}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.5.0/SettingsSwitches.png}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1.6.0/Settings_Switches.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Switches Tab}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_settings_switches_tab}
\end{figure}

   The following settings exist in the \textsl{Switches} tab:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Start With Default State}
      \item \textbf{Hide Non Fatal Errors}
      \item \textbf{Show Splash Screen}
      \item \textbf{Log Load times}
      \item \textbf{Log XML headers}
      \item \textbf{Include disabled data in XML files}
      \item \textbf{Enable GUI}
      \item \textbf{Enable CLI}
      \item \textbf{Enable Auto Instance}
      \item \textbf{Enable Single Master}
   \end{enumber}

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Start With Default State}{Switches!Start With Default State}
   Requires \textsl{Yoshimi} to be restarted, to take effect.
   This setting allows \textsl{Yoshimi} to be initialized with one's own
   initial state file that matches one's usual work setup.
   The default state file is named
   \texttt{\textasciitilde/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.state}.

   If the \textbf{Reset} button on the main screen is click, then this file is
   loaded, instead of reverting to the first-run default state of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \itempar{Hide Non Fatal Errors}{Main Settings!Hide Non-Fatal Errors}
   Especially when running from the command line (with reports going there
   too), under some circumstances one can get a swamp of low-level error
   messages (such as XRUNs) that is so large that one cannot work out what is
   going on. This feature disables these error messages; it is a work in
   progress to catch the bulk of them, while still reporting top-level messages
   and ones that cause a forced exit (surely not!)

   \itempar{Show Splash Screen}{Main Settings!Show Splash Screen}
   This item will speed up the start-up of \textsl{Yoshimi} slightly
   if unchecked, by not showing the splash screen while files are being loaded.

   \itempar{Log Load times}{Switches!Log Load times}
   Provides a way of noting problematic patch sets, which may take a long
   enough time to load so as to affect the smoothness of playback.

   \itempar{Log XML headers}{Main Settings!Log XML headers}
   This item sends the information to the console window
   (or \texttt{stderr}) so that
   one can then see what \textsl{ynAddSubFX}/\textsl{Yoshimi}
   version created the file.

   \itempar{Include disabled data in XML files}{Main Settings!Include disabled data}
   Allows disabled data to be stored in the XML file.
   This makes it a lot easier to re-enable a setting later.

   \itempar{Enable GUI}{Switches!Enable GUI}
   If checked, the user-interface is enabled.  This setting is normally what one
   wants.  If one unchecks it, it warns that disabling the GUI
   can only be reversed from the command line.

   \itempar{Enable CLI}{Switches!Enable CLI}
   If checked, the command-line interface is enabled.
   Note as of V 1.5.6 it has been possible to disable both the user-interface and
   the command line at the same time. This means that Yoshimi can only be closed
   by sending a special MIDI message (CC 99, 68, CC 98, 68). Alternatively one
   could send a system shutdown message.

   \itempar{Enable Auto Instance}{Switches!Enable Auto Instance}
      If checked, then, if any other instances were open at the time one closes
      the main instance, then these other instances will be re-opened next time
      one runs \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   If these instances each have their own
   \textbf{Start with Default State} switch checked, and if
   there is a valid default state for them, then these instances will also have
   their default state loaded.
   Therefore, just by starting the main instance, one can have a
   highly-detailed multi-instance setup installed.
   This setup will include such things as JACK/ALSA audio
   and MIDI, and a complete patch set, etc.

   \itempar{Enable Single Master}{Switches!Enable Single Master}
      If checked, then once running, trying to start a new instance from the
      desktop ( or command line) will instead get the next available instance in
      the currently running one. This is both more efficient use of resources,
      and ensures consistency. Top-level instances cannot communicate independently
      changed configuration settings. (new from V 1.6.0)

   \paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / Switches / History Locks}
   \label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_historylocks}
   \index{new!History Locks}
   New in \textsl{Yoshimi} V 1.6.0 there is a sub-panel \textsl{History Locks}

   This is a set of config switches so that one can independently lock each of
   the history lists against change. In the locked state loading or saving new
   files will not update the associated history list at all. At any time, these
   lists can of course be unlocked again. This is especially useful when changing
   these settings via MIDI NRPNs (also new).

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Instrument}
      \item \textbf{Patch Set}
      \item \textbf{Scale}
      \item \textbf{State}
      \item \textbf{Vector}
      \item \textbf{Midi Learn}
   \end{enumber}

   The default state is 'unlocked' as shown in the image above, retaining
   compatibility with older versions of \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   Finally, the history file is unique in that it is entirely internally
   generated, and the file is common across all instances. Although treated as
   a config setting, the new switch settings are actually embedded in the
   history file itself, which ensures consistency.


\paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / Jack}
\label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_jack}

   JACK is the "Jack Audio Connection Kit", very useful for increasing audio
   performance and configurability.
   When using the JACK audio backend, instruments can be individually routed
   and sent to the main L/R outputs. This is controlled from the
   panel window,
   \sectionref{subsec:mixer_panel_window},
   and the settings are saved with all the other parameters.

   Direct part outputs carry the Part and Insertion effects, but not the
   System ones.

      \item \textbf{Set as preferred MIDI}
      \item \textbf{Jack Server}

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Jack Midi Source}{JACK!MIDI source}
   Jack MIDI Source.
   It is possible to have more than one JACK MIDI source.  This option
   tells this instance of \textsl{Yoshimi} which JACK
   client to try to auto-connect to for MIDI input.
   This option corresponds to the \textsl{Yoshimi} command line option
   \texttt{--jack-midi(=device)}.

   Values: \texttt{default*, name} name; see "man jackd" for details.

   \itempar{Set as preferred MIDI}{JACK!set as preferred MIDI}
   Set as preferred MIDI for JACK.
   This setting determines which MIDI connections a particular instance will
   first attempt. The switches are mutually exclusive across JACK and ALSA,
   so if one checks ALSA for MIDI, it automatically unchecks JACK for MIDI.
   As well as from the GUI, this setting can be set (for instance 0) from the
   command line, both at start-up and once running.

   \itempar{Jack Server}{JACK!server name}
   Jack Server Name.
   It is possible to have more than one JACK server running.  This option
   tells this instance of \textsl{Yoshimi} which JACK server to use.
   This option corresponds to the \textsl{Yoshimi} command line option
   \texttt{--jack-audio(=server)}.

   Values: \texttt{default*, name} name, as set by
   \texttt{jackd --name}; see "man jackd" for details.

   \itempar{Set as preferred audio}{JACK!set as preferred audio}
   Set as preferred audio for JACK.
   This setting determines which audio connections a particular instance will
   first attempt. The switches are mutually exclusive across JACK and ALSA,
   so if one checks ALSA for audio, it automatically unchecks JACK for audio.
   As well as from the GUI, this setting can be set (for instance 0) from the
   command line, both at start-up and once running.
   Note that any of these setting changes require a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}
   to take effect.

   \itempar{Autoconnect audio}{JACK!autoconnect audio}
   Sets \textsl{Yoshimi} to connect automatically to the JACK server, just like
   the \texttt{-K} command-line option does.
   (However, note that the command-line has no way to disable this feature it
   the configuration has been saved.)

\paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / Alsa}
\label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_alsa_tab}

   A significant improvement is to the handling of ALSA audio, which is still
   very important for some people. Until now, \textsl{Yoshimi} has insisted
   on a 2-channel, 16-bit format. Tests have shown that virtually all
   motherboard sound chipsets will handle this, but many external ones don't.

   From \textsl{Yoshimi} 1.3.6 onwards, when using ALSA audio,
   \textsl{Yoshimi} first tries to connect 2 channels at 32 bit depth.  If
   that connection does not succeed, then \textsl{Yoshimi} negotiates
   whatever the soundcard will support.  For example, a card might support
   only 24 bits, and 6 channels.  So \textsl{Yoshimi} will fall back to
   24 bit, and, due to its own limits, will use only channels 1 and 2.
   With external sound modules in mind, endian swaps are also implemented.

   To be able to reliably use ALSA audio, one needs to set a card name, not just
   "Default".  In a terminal window enter the following command:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ cat /proc/asound/card*/id
   \end{verbatim}

   The result of this command should be something like:

   \begin{verbatim}
      PCH
      K6
   \end{verbatim}

   Go to the ALSA settings tab illustrated below, and in
   \textsl{Alsa Audio Device} enter, for example, "hw:PCH".
   This ensures one will always connect to this card at startup regardless of
   the order this and other ones.  Another benefit of using this hardware name
   is that ALSA will now use \textsl{Yoshimi}'s internal
   buffer size (256), otherwise ALSA will force \textsl{Yoshimi} to accept its
   default size (usually 1024).

   One can also set the sample rate, but bear in mind that not all cards can use
   all of these.  The sample rates 44100 and 48000 are almost always available.
   If one sets a Midi Device as well (such as a keyboard) Yoshimi will try to
   find and connect to this device at startup.

   To find the MIDI devices available, try:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ grep Client /proc/asound/seq/clients
   \end{verbatim}

   The result of this command should be something like:

   \begin{verbatim}
      Client info
      Client   0 : "System" [Kernel]
      Client  14 : "Midi Through" [Kernel]
      Client 128 : "TiMidity" [User]
   \end{verbatim}

   It is not obvious how ALSA audio is controlled and who takes command.  If
   one sets a specific audio destination, then \textsl{Yoshimi} makes a
   request.  It's often a negotiation on bit depth and channel count, but
   \textsl{Yoshimi} nearly always gets to decide the buffer size, which is the
   internal buffer size.  However, if the destination is 'default' then ALSA
   decides on the sound card, bit depth, number of channels and the buffer
   size, and \textsl{Yoshimi} will set it's internal buffer size to match.  On
   most machines this seems to be 1024.

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Alsa Midi Source}{ALSA!MIDI Source}
   ALSA MIDI Source.
   The purpose of this setting is the same as the command line option
   \texttt{--alsa-midi="name"}.
   It is used so that \textsl{Yoshimi} can auto connect to a MIDI source
   such as a keyboard.  For example, the one that Will has identifies itself
   as name = "Hua Xing".
   A port name, such as "128:0" (for one of the ports provided by
   \textsl{TiMidity}) should work as well.
   If the destination is "default",
   then ALSA decides on the sound card, bit depth, number of channels and the
   buffer size, and \textsl{Yoshimi} will set it's internal buffer size to
   match.  On most machines this always seems to be 1024.

   Values: \texttt{default*}

   \itempar{Set as preferred MIDI}{ALSA!Set as preferred MIDI}
   Set as preferred MIDI for ALSA.
   This setting determines which MIDI connections a particular instance will
   first attempt. The switches are mutually exclusive across JACK and ALSA,
   so if one checks ALSA for MIDI, it automatically unchecks JACK for MIDI.
   As well as from the GUI, this setting can be set (for instance 0) from the
   command line, both at start-up and once running.

   \itempar{Alsa Audio Device}{ALSA!audio device}
   ALSA Audio Device.
   This specifies the sound card to which \textsl{Yoshimi} can connect.
   Normally, this will be an ALSA hardware specification such as
   "hw:0".
   ALSA audio also lets one connect to a sound card by name. For example,
   with a Komplete Audio KA 6 sound card, the device specification is
   "hw:K6". This feature is particularly useful for USB modules, as one can
   never be sure where they appear numerically.

   Values: \texttt{default*}

   Note, that if it is left as "default" then all aspects will be at their
   default settings. This includes sample rate and buffer size.

   \itempar{Set as preferred audio}{ALSA!Set as preferred audio}
   Set as preferred audio for ALSA.
   This setting determines which audio connections a particular instance will
   first attempt. The switches are mutually exclusive across JACK and ALSA,
   so if one checks ALSA for audio, it automatically unchecks JACK for audio.
   As well as from the GUI, this setting can be set (for instance 0) from the
   command line, both at start-up and once running.

   \itempar{Samplerate}{ALSA!sample rate}
   Sample Rate.
   Sets the quality of the sound, higher is better, but it uses more CPU.  One
   can select from a list.  Note that both ALSA and JACK will support the
   192000 rate, if the sound-card supports it.  To find out the internal delay
   in milliseconds, divide the buffer-size value by the Sample Rate and
   multiply the result by 1000 (256 / 44100 * 1000 = 5.8 ms).

   Note that, as of version 1.3.6, the \textbf{Period Size} field has been
   removed from the \textbf{Alsa} tab, and is replaced by the
   \textbf{Internal Buffer Size} field in the \textbf{Main Settings} tab.
   Note that any of these setting changes require a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}
   to take effect.

%  \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}: if one wants a sample-rate that
%  is not in the list, select "Custom" and change the value from the right.
%  Default is 44100.

   Values: \texttt{192000, 96000, 48000*, 44100}

\paragraph{Menu / Yoshimi / Settings / MIDI}
\label{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_ccs}

   The CC settings tab has been renamed the "MIDI" tab.
   This tab, shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_settings_cc},
   presents MIDI bank-root, bank, program change, and extended program
   change settings, plus some new values.

   The concepts of banks and roots is very useful.
   See \sectionref{subsec:concepts_banks_and_roots}.
   The settings in this tab affect the usage of banks and root changes
   controlled by MIDI messages, thereby making \textsl{Yoshimi} able to
   implement MIDI automation.

   For many of the controls in this section, if the control number is
   already in use for another purpose, one might get a warning like the
   following:

   \itempar{Bank Root Change}{MIDI settings!bank root change}
   Bank Root Change.
   Defines which MIDI controller one wants to use. This has been changed in
   V 1.5.11 so that it is consistent with Bank Change.

   Values: \texttt{LSB, MSB*, Off}

   \itempar{Bank Change}{MIDI settings!bank change}
   Bank Change.
   Defines which MIDI controller one wants to use.

   Values: \texttt{LSB, MSB*, Off}

   When combined, these Bank Select messages provide
   \texttt{128*128} = 16384 banks.

   Note that normally MIDI Controller 0 = CC0 = Bank Select MSB, and MIDI
   Controller 32 = CC32 = Bank Select LSB. Also a Bank (and Bank Root)
   selection simply makes these available for the next Program Change event.
   The program doesn't change after changing a bank, until an actual Program
   Change is sent.
   Bank/Root changes can be completely disabled; some hardware synthesizers
   don't play nice with banks.

   \itempar{Enable Program Change}{MIDI settings!enable program change}

   Values: \texttt{Off*, On}

   Enables/disables MIDI program change.
   Program changes can be completely disabled, but some hardware synths don't
   play nice!

   \itempar{Enable Part On Program Change}{MIDI settings!enable part change}

   Values: \texttt{Off*, On}

   The part is automatically enabled if the MIDI program was changed on this
   part.

   \itempar{Enable Extended Program Change}{MIDI settings!enable extended program change}

   Values: \texttt{Off*, On}

   \itempar{Extended Program Change}{MIDI settings!extended change}
   If enabled, a new reddish button, \textbf{Pending}, appears.
   Once the change has been made in the scroll list, click this button
   to set the change.
   \textbf{Warning:}
   The \textbf{Save and Close} button will not result in the removal of the
   \textbf{Pending} button.
   This result seems counter-intuitive, but the pending button is not removed
   here because, at that point, it still hasn't actually been either set or
   abandoned. It remains available for when the user actually makes up their
   mind.

   Values: \texttt{0-127, 110*}

   \itempar{Enable Incoming NRPNs}{MIDI settings!enabable incoming NRPN}
   Set by default, so one might not notice it at first.
   Disabling incoming NPRNs stops rogue MIDI sources from screwing things up.
   Disabling it also lets one use the NRPN CCs for other functions,
   if wanting to use a programmable hardware controller.

   Values: \texttt{Off, On*}

   \itempar{Ignore Reset all CCs}{MIDI settings!Ignore Reset all CCs}
   Causes \textsl{Yoshimi} to ignore this message.
   \index{CC monitor}
   For example, using \textsl{Yoshimi}'s CC monitor (see the next
   item), Will found that one software sequencer was sending CC 121 (reset all
   controllers) at the start of some song segments.  Checking this option
   prevents unwanted resets.

   Values: \texttt{Off*, On}

   \itempar{Log Incoming CCs}{MIDI settings!Log Incoming CCs}
   This setting is now saved (in the \texttt{config} file). It is there
   as an aid for when \textsl{Yoshimi} appears to ignore MIDI commands,
   as it tells one exactly what \textsl{Yoshimi} thinks it received.

   Values: \texttt{Off*, On}

   \itempar{Show Learn Editor}{MIDI settings!Show Learn Editor}
   Sets whether the MIDI Learn editor window is to be opened when learning a
   new control. One might find that when learning a new control one
   wants to change the \textbf{Min} and \textbf{Max} settings.

   Values: \texttt{Off, On*}

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / MIDI Learn...}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_midi_learn}

   The \textbf{MIDI Learn} functionality of \textsl{Yoshimi} gives it the
   ability to redirect MIDI input from physical controllers to various
   user-interface controls in \textsl{Yoshimi}, so that the user can basically
   control \textsl{Yoshimi}'s knobs and sliders via MIDI equipment.

   There's enough to say about this topic so that we describe it in a section
   of its own.
   See \sectionref{sec:midi_learn} for details.

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / View Manual...}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_view_manual}

   This menu entry brings up the most recent version of this manual, which is
   now include as part of a \textsl{Yoshimi} installation.
   Note that some viewers might not work properly
   (e.g. \texttt{apvlv} (\cite{apvlv}).

\subsubsection{Menu / Yoshimi / Exit}
\label{subsubsec:menu_yoshimi_exit}

   Simply exits from \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   The user is prompted if unsaved changes exist, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_change_exit}.

   One can sometimes get a false parameters-changed warning if one
   scrolls through one of the menu type entries without actually changing it.
   Better safe than sorry!

\subsection{Menu / Paths}
\label{subsec:menu_paths}

   This menu entry provides a more direct way to set up the Bank Root and
   the Presets directories.  It contains the following items:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Bank Root Dirs...}.
         The Paths Bank Root Dirs dialog is described in
         \sectionref{subsubsec:menu_patch_sets_patch_bank_roots},
         which shows
         \figureref{fig:bank_root_paths}, and describes this dialog in full.
      \item \textbf{Preset Dirs...}.
         The \textsl{Yoshimi} preset directories are the locations where
         presets can be found.  See below for details.
   \end{enumber}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} preset directories are the locations where
   presets can be found.  When first installed, the system
   preset directory is one of the following, depending on whether
   \textsl{Yoshimi} was installed via a package manager or via source code:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /usr/share/yoshimi/presets
      /usr/local/share/yoshimi/presets
   \end{verbatim}

   The user can provide additional directories for the presets, up to a limit
   of 128 directories (the same limit as for roots and banks).
   These directories are useful for containing copies of the system
   presets that one can modify safely, and for providing custom
   presets designed by the user.

   The following items are provided by the preset directory settings:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Preset list}
      \item \textbf{Add preset directory...}
      \item \textbf{Remove preset directory...}
      \item \textbf{Make default}
      \item \textbf{Save and Close}
      \item \textbf{Close Unsaved}

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Preset list}{Yoshimi Presets!Preset List}
   This interface element contains a list of preset directories.
   By default, the only directory present is the installed preset directory.
   For example, \texttt{/usr/share/yoshimi/presets}.

   \textbf{Tip:}
   \index{tip!preset directory}
   If there is no directory in this dialog, then one must
   add one, otherwise there is no place to store the presets.
   So make this one of the first items specified when first running
   \textsl{Yoshimi}!

   Another example would be this project; let YOSHIMI-DOC be the directory
   where this project is stored.  Then one can add
   \texttt{YOSHIMI-DOC/config/yoshimi/presets} to this list, using the
   button described next.

   \itempar{Add preset directory...}{Yoshimi Presets!Add Directory}
   Use this button and dialog to add a preset directory to the list, for
   easy access.

   Press the \textbf{Add preset directory...} button, revealing the
   following dialog.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

   Navigate to the desired directory, select it, and press the \textbf{Ok}
   button.  (There is no need to press the \textbf{Save and Close} button;
   the directory is added as soon as \textsl{OK} is clicked.  However, one
   tends to want to click it anyway, to be sure.)
   \textsl{Important}:  Restart \textsl{Yoshimi} to use the preset directory.

   \itempar{Remove preset directory...}{Yoshimi Presets!Remove Directory}
   Select one of the preset directories in the preset list, then press this
   button to remove the preset directory from the list of preset
   directories.  It is removed immediately, with no need to confirm the
   deletion, click an OK button, or click a Save button.

   \itempar{Make default presets}{Yoshimi Presets!Make Default}
   Make Default Presets Directory.
   Select one of the preset directories in the preset list, then press this
   button to make the preset directory the default preset directory.
   It should be a directory for which one has write permissions.
   By default, it is \texttt{\textasciitilde/.config/yoshimi/presets}.

\subsection{Menu / Scales}
\label{subsec:menu_scales}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is a microtonal synthesizer, and is capable of a wide
   range of microtonal scales.  Improvement to its features and the accuracy of
   the scales have been made in the 1.5.0 series of \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   Scales are discussed in detail in
   \sectionref{sec:Scales}.

\subsection{Menu / State}
\label{subsec:menu_state}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} state is saved in files with the extension
   \texttt{.state}.  These files are also XML files.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} "state" will include the system settings, as well as all
   patches. Some of these settings (such as Oscillator Size) can only be
   realised on a reload if loading via the command line at startup.

%  However,
%  the ones that can't be dynamically changed will be set, and if the
%  configuration is then saved, will be set on the next load -- this is not
%  ideal. We are working on it, but don't expect improvements soon!

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Load}
      \item \textbf{Save}
      \item \textbf{Save as Default} (new, not yet shown)
      \item \textbf{Recent States...}
   \end{enumber}

   State files were normally stored in the
   user's \texttt{.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.state} file, but
   now \textsl{Yoshimi} offers the user's home directory instead.

   \itempar{State Load}{State!Load}
   Provides a way to load a previously-saved \textsl{Yoshimi} state file.

   This item is a standard \textsl{Yoshimi} file dialog.
   Note that XML text is shown in the preview pane, but, if XML compression is
   set, then a large question mark is all that would be shown.

   \itempar{State Save}{State!Save}
   Provides a way to save a new or modified \textsl{Yoshimi} state file.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{menu/State/save-state-file.jpg}
   \caption{Yoshimi Menu, State Save}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_menu_state_save}
\end{figure}

   This item is a standard \textsl{Yoshimi} file dialog.

   \itempar{Save as Default}{State!Save default}
   This item simply makes the current state the new default state when starting
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   This item is effective only if the \textbf{Start With Default State}
   option is checked in \textbf{Yoshimi / Settings}. This item is also
   exceptional as it will \textsl{not} appear in the history list, and so
   will not be offered as a normal load.

   \itempar{Recent States}{State!Recent}
   This item brings up a list of states to select.
   The Recent States dialog will not come up if there are no states that have
   yet been managed.
