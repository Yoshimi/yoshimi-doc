\section{PADsynth}
\label{sec:padsynth}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} PADsynth dialog is a complex dialog for creating a
   pad instrument,  "PADsynth" or "PADnote" is engine that makes very
   beautiful pads and other instruments. (These instruments can be exported
   for use with other programs too).

   The PADsynth dialog consists of two major tabs,
   \textbf{Harmonic Structure} and \textbf{EnvelopesLFOs}.
   Each of these tabs is complex, so the discussion
   will break the tabs down by sub-sections.

\subsection{PADsynth / Algorithm}
\label{subsec:padsynth_algorithm}

   The complexity of the PADsynth dailog merely reflects the complexity of the
   PADsynth algorithms.

\subsubsection{PADsynth / Algorithm / General}
\label{subsubsec:padsynth_algorithm_general}

   The PADsynth algorithm generates very beautiful sounds, even if its idea is
   much simpler than other algorithms. It generates a perfectly looped
   wave-table sample which can be used in instruments. It easily generates
   sounds of ensembles, choirs, metallic sounds (bells) and many other types of
   sound.  Paul Nasca wanted to make this algorithm known, and everyone is
   welcome to learn and use this algorithm into one's projects or products
   (non-commercial or commercial).
   
   Quote \cite{zyndoc}:

      You will not be disappointed by this algorithm.

      I hope that this algorithm will be implemented in many software/hardware
      synthesizers. Use it, spread it, write about it, create beautiful
      instruments with it. If your synthesizer uses plenty of samples, you can
      use this algorithm to generate many ready-to-use samples.

      This algorithm, this page, the images, the implementations from this
      page, the audio examples, the parameter files from this page
      are released under Public Domain by Nasca Octavian Paul.

   In order to understand how this algorithm works, one needs to be familiar
   with howÂ to think about musical instruments. Please read an introduction
   for the description of the meaning and the importance of bandwidth of each
   harmonic and randomness.

   This algorithm generates some large wave-tables that can be played at
   different speeds to get the desired sound. This algorithm describes only
   how these wave-tables are generated. The result is a perfectly looped
   wave-table.  Unlike other synthesis methods, which use the
   Inverse Fast Fourier Transform, this one does not use overlap/add methods
   and there is only one IFFT for the whole sample.

   The basic steps are:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item Make a very large array that represents the amplitude spectrum of
         the sound (all default values are zero).
      \item Generate the distribution of each harmonic in the frequency
         spectrum and add it to the array.
      \item Put random phases to each frequency of the spectrum.
      \item Do a single Inverse Fourier Transform of the whole spectrum. There
         is no need of any overlapping windows, because there is only one
         single IFFT for the whole sample. 
   \end{enumber}

   The output is a sample which can be used as a wave-table.

%  In the next image, the steps are represented graphically:

\subsubsection{PADsynth / Algorithm / Harmonic Bandwidth}
\label{subsubsec:padsynth_algorithm_harmonic_bandwidth}

   We consider one harmonic (overtone) as being composed of many frequencies.
   These sine components of one harmonic are spread over a certain band of
   frequencies.  Higher harmonics have a wider bandwidth. In natural
   choirs/ensembles the bandwidth is proportional to the frequency of the
   harmonic.
   
%  Here is an example of a spectrum of an instrument generated by ZynAddSubFX:
%
%     TODO:  A GRAPHIC, full spectrum, closeup of the spectrum

   The harmonics become wider and wider, until a certain frequency, where
   they may merge into a noise band (as in the full spectrum image from above
   shows). This is a normal thing and we recommend to not avoid this by
   limiting the bandwidth of the harmonics.

%  The frequency distribution of one harmonic/overtone (or the harmonic
%  profile).

   This describes the function of the spread of the harmonic.
   Here are some examples of how they can be spread:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item  A special case is where there is only a single sine component
         inside the harmonic In this case, the harmonic and the "sine
         component" are the same thing.
      \item  Detuned. In this case there are two sine components which are
         detuned.
      \item  Evenly spread inside the harmonic (all components have the same
         amplitude)
      \item  Normal (Gaussian) distribution. The sine components amplitude are
         bell-shaped. The largest amplitude is in the center of the band. This
         distribution gives the most natural sounds (it simulates a very, very
         large ensemble).
   \end{enumber}

   Of course, one can use many other profiles of the harmonic.
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}'s PADsynth module offers many ways to generate the
   harmonic profile.  Also, it's very important that the harmonic must have the
   same amplitude, regardless of the profile functions/parameters and the
   bandwidth.
   For many more details of this algorithm, see Paul Nasca's document
   \cite{zyndoc}.

\paragraph{Tip: Using the PADsynth}
\label{tips_using_the_padsynth}
\index{tips!padsynth usage}

   Keep in mind that the resulting wave-tables are perfectly looped.
   There are some sound-generation ideas to keep in mind:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item When using the wave-tables for instruments, on each Note On, start
         from a random position and not from the start. This avoids hearing the
         same sound on each keystroke.
      \item One can use the same wave-table for generating stereo sounds, by
         playing the same wave-table at different positions for left and right.
         The best method is to create a difference between left and
         right of N/2.
      \item Generate different wave-tables for different pitches and use the
         one that is closest to the desired pitch.
      \item Upsample or downsample the amplitude array of the harmonic before
         running the algorithm, according to the fundamental frequency. In this
         case we need to set a parameter "base\_frequency" which represents the
         frequency where the array is left unchanged. 
   \end{enumber}

   Example:
   We have A\_orig[]={1,2,1,3,0,0,1,0} and base\_frequency is equal to 440 Hz
   Here are some cases:

A[] for 440 Hz: is the same as A\_orig[] 

A[] for 220 Hz: is the A\_orig[] upsampled by factor of 2

so: A[]={1, 1, 1.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 2, 3, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0}

(the original A\_orig amplitudes are shown as bold) 

A[] for 880 Hz: the A\_orig[] is downsampled by a factor of 2

so: A[]={1.5, 2, 0, 0.5} 

A[] for F Hz: the A\_orig[] is scaled by a factor of 440/F.

   Even if this idea is very simple, the resulting sounds are very natural,
   because it keeps the spectrum constant according to the frequency of the
   harmonic and not to the number of the harmonics. This follows from the
   document where Paul Nasca describes some principles regarding synthesis.

   The type of wave-shaping distortion has much influence on how the
   overtones are being placed. Sometimes, one gets a "fat" bass, and
   sometimes, high frequencies are added, making the sound "crystal clear".

   \textbf{Atan \& Sigmoid}.
   This is the default setting. It is an easy way to apply loudness to a wave
   without getting undesired high overtones. Thus, it can be used both for
   making instruments that sound like "real" ones, but also for electronic
   music. The transformation turns, roughly said, every amplitude into a
   square amplitude. Thus, sine, power, pulse and triangle turn into a usual
   square wave, while a saw turns into a phased square wave. A chirp wave
   turns into a kind of phase modulated square wave.

   \textbf{Quants} ("Qnts")
   Quantization adds high overtones early. It can be seen as an unnatural
   effect, which is often used for electronic music.  The transformation is a
   bit similar to building the lower sum of a wave, mathematically said. This
   means that the transformation effect turns an "endless high" sampled
   wave into only a few samples. The more distortion one applies, the fewer
   samples will be used. Indeed, this is equivalent to say that more input
   amplification is used. To see this, here is a small sample of code, where
   "ws" is the (correctly scaled amount of input amplification, and "n" the
   number of original samples.

   If one turns on quantisation very high, one might be confused that,
   especially high notes, make no sound. The reason: High frequencies are
   "forgotten" if one samples with only few samples. Also, the sign of an
   amplitude can be forgotten. This behaviour might make some quantisations a
   bit unexpected.

   \textbf{Limiting} ("Lmt*" and "Clip")
   Limiting usually means that for a signal, the amplitude is modified
   because it exceeds its maximum value. Overdrive, as often used for
   guitars, is often achieved by limiting: It happens because an amplifier
   "overdrives" the maximum amplitude it can deliver.

   ZynAddSubFX has two types of limiting. Soft limiting, here as Lmt, means
   that the sound may not exceed a certain value. If the amplitude does so,
   it will simply be reduced to the limiting value. The overtones are
   generated in the lower frequencies first.

   Hard limiting, is also called clipping and abbreviated Clip. This means
   that if the maximum is exceeded, instead of being constant at the limiting
   value, the original signal still has some influence on the output signal.
   Still, it does not exceed the limiting value. For ZynAddSubFX, a signal
   exceeding the limiting value will continue to grow "in the negative". This
   leads to overtones being generated on the full frequency band.
