\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi},
   the software synthesizer derived from the great
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} \cite{zynaddsubfx} software
   synthesizer.  Because of their similarities, much of this document also
   applies to \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} and depends upon \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}
   documentation and diagrams.

   Yoshimi is a MIDI software synthesizer for Linux. It synthesizes in real
   time, can run polyphonic and/or monophonic in multiple simultaneous
   patches in one or more MIDI channels, has broad microtonal capability,
   and much more. It includes extensive addititive, subtractive, and PAD
   synth capabilities which can be run simultaneously within the same patch.
   It also has comprehensive effects capabilities.

   Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of ZynAddSubFX (Copyright 2002-2009
   Nasca Octavian Paul), development of Yoshimi has continued for
   quite a while now in its own directions. These include major
   optimizations for audio and MIDI performance, and more recently
   progressive development of user-level access to all controls. At the same
   time refinement continues, both visually and within the code.

   What are the advantages of
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versus \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}?
   Well, this information may be outdated by now, but 
   \textsl{Yoshimi} is supposed to have better JACK support
   than does \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} also has a cleaner and neater graphical user interface.
   On the other hand, \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} has a few features that
   \textsl{Yoshimi} does not, such as being able to easily record
   the output waveforms.

   The structure of this document is a struggle.  No matter which route is
   taken, there's no way to avoid jumping all over this document to
   adequately cover a topic.  Therefore, the section are basically provided
   in the order their contents appear in the user interface of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  To help the reader jump around this document, multiple
   links and references are supplied.

   Usage tips
   \index{tips!in document}
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tips:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tip".

   Run \textsl{Yoshimi}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK}, which
   complicates the discussion of \textsl{Yoshimi}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Yoshimi} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).

   Then run \textsl{Yoshimi} so that it uses ALSA for audio and ALSA for
   MIDI.  Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ yoshimi -a -A &
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Yosh-splash-OTW-1.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Splash Screen!}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen}
\end{figure}

   One sees a brief message, and then the splash screen.
   We show the splash screen, figure~\ref{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen},
   here because it goes away too
   fast when one runs \textsl{Yoshimi}!
   What fun is that?

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.3.5/yoshimi-first-screen.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Main Screen}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}
\end{figure}

%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{yoshimi-first-screen.jpg}
%  This figure a bit out-of-date (it does not show the new "Part of"
%  feature)
   
   Then the \textsl{Yoshimi} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}.

   For this manual, we describe the main window as being composed of
   the following sections:

\begin{enumber}
   \item \textbf{Menu}.
   \item \textbf{Top Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Effects Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Bottom Panel}.  Includes the VU-meter at the bottom.
\end{enumber}

There's a lot going on with \textsl{Yoshimi}, and there's no way
to describe it in linear order.  This manual will describe how to do useful
things in each of the sections noted above, while leaving some of the
details to be described in later sections, to which reference can be made
for these details.  This document will depend heavily on index entries and
references.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In summary, we can say that you will absolutely love \textsl{Yoshimi}.

There are many topics that this document does  not yet treat:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Changing the colors and style of the GUI, as seen in some
         versions of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  This does not yet seem possible,
         because the synth part is not truly separate from the GUI, and the
         \textsl{Yoshimi} developers have not found it easy to recode the
         FLTK GUI.
      \item Building the source code using cmake or GNU automake, and
         running the code against valgrind for detecting memory errors.
   \end{itemize}
