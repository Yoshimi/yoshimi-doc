\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   Still working on catching up to all the new features in 1.3.8.
   There are a \textbf{lot} of them.

   This document was inspired by finding a fairly thorough wiki version of a
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} manual (see reference \cite{zynwiki}).  That wiki,
   and the Open Document Format version of it, provided a lot of screen
   shots and a detailed survey of the settings and parameters of
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  It inspired me to be even more thorough in
   describing \textsl{Yoshimi}.

\subsection{Yoshimi Versus ZynAddSubFX}
\label{subsec:introduction_yoshimi_vs_zyn}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi},
   the software synthesizer derived from the great
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} \cite{zynaddsubfx} software
   synthesizer.  Because of their common origin, much of this document also
   applies to \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} and depends upon some \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}
   documentation and diagrams.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is an algorithmic MIDI software synthesizer for Linux.
   It synthesizes in real time, can run polyphonic or monophonic, with multiple
   simultaneous patches in one or more MIDI channels, has broad microtonal
   capability, and much more. It includes extensive addititive, subtractive,
   and pad synth capabilities which can be run simultaneously within the
   same patch.  It also has eight audio effects modules.

   Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} (Copyright
   2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul), development of \textsl{Yoshimi} has
   continued for quite a while now in its own directions. These include
   major optimizations for audio and MIDI performance, and more recently
   progressive development of user-level access to all controls. At the same
   time refinement continues, both visually and within the code.

   What are the advantages of
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versus \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}?
   At one time \textsl{Yoshimi} had better JACK support
   than \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}, but that is no longer true.
   Both projects are now in active development, and both are
   progressing along their respective roadmaps.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} currently has a cleaner graphical user interface, while
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} has a major user-interface upgrade planned.
   On the other hand, \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} has a few features that
   \textsl{Yoshimi} does not, such as being able to easily record
   the output waveforms.  There may be internal differences of importance to
   a developer.  So, really, it is not clear that there is really a big
   advantage to one over the other... use them both and make your own
   decision!

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document is a struggle.  No matter which route is
   taken, there's no way to avoid jumping all over this document to
   adequately cover a topic.  Therefore, the sections are basically provided
   in the order their contents appear in the user interface of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  To help the reader jump around this document, multiple
   links and references are supplied.

   \index{tips!in document}
   Usage tips
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tip:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   \index{bugs!in document}
   Bug notes
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Yoshimi} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "Bug:".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "bugs".

   \index{new!in document}
   New features
   since the last version are flagged with "New:"

   \index{todo!in document}
   TODO items
   are also present, in the same vein.
   This document currently has a lot of them!

\subsection{Yoshimi Mailing List}
\label{subsec:introduction_mailing_list}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} project used to have an email listserv at
   SourceForge, but the unreliability of the site has prompted a move to a
   new mailing list.  See reference \cite{yoshiminews}.  The team have
   managed to port across all the old yoshimi-user archives to this new
   site.  See reference \cite{yoshiminewsarchive}.

   Subscribe to the \textsl{Yoshimi} mailing list with an e-mail to:
   \url{yoshimi-request@freelists.org} or by visiting 
   \url{http://www.freelists.org/list/yoshimi}.

   To post to the list, send an email to: \url{yoshimi@freelists.org}.

\subsection{Let's Get Started with Yoshimi!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Yoshimi}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK}, which
   complicates the discussion of \textsl{Yoshimi}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Yoshimi} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Yoshimi} so that it uses ALSA for audio and ALSA for
   MIDI.  Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.
   See \sectionref{sec:yoshimi_man_page}.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ yoshimi -a -A &
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Yosh-splash-OTW-1.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Splash Screen!}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen}
\end{figure}

   One sees a brief message, and then the splash screen.
   We show the splash screen, figure~\ref{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen},
   here because it goes away too
   fast when one runs \textsl{Yoshimi}!
   What fun is that?

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.3.8/yoshimi-first-screen.jpg}
   \caption{Yoshimi Main Screen, 1.3.8}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}
\end{figure}

%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{yoshimi-first-screen.jpg}
%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.3.5/yoshimi-first-screen.png}
%  That figure a bit out-of-date (it does not show the new "Part of"
%  feature), so we've replaced it with a new screen capture.
   
   Then the \textsl{Yoshimi} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}.

   TODO:  Discuss the new UI elements.

   For this manual, we describe the main window as being composed of
   the following sections:

\begin{enumber}
   \item \textbf{Menu}.
   \item \textbf{Top Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Effects Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Bottom Panel}.  Includes the VU-meter at the bottom.
\end{enumber}

   There's a lot going on with \textsl{Yoshimi}, and there's no way to describe
   it in linear order.  This manual will describe how to do useful things in
   each of the sections noted above, while leaving some of the details to be
   described in later sections, to which reference can be made for the details.
   This document depends heavily on index entries and references.

   Finally, if one grabs the latest source code for \textsl{Yoshimi}, in the
   'examples' directory there is a complete song set, 'OutThere.mid' and
   'OutThere.xmz'. Together these produce a fairly complex 12 part tune that
   makes \textsl{Yoshimi} work quite hard.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

   In summary, we can say that you will absolutely love \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   There are some topics that this document does not yet treat:

      \begin{itemize}
         \item Changing the colors and style of the GUI, as seen in some
            versions of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  This does not yet seem possible,
            because the synth part is not truly separate from the GUI, and the
            \textsl{Yoshimi} developers have not found it easy to recode the
            FLTK GUI.
      \end{itemize}
