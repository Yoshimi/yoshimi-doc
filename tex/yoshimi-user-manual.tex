\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document was inspired by finding a fairly thorough wiki version of a
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} manual (see reference \cite{zynwiki}).  That wiki, and
   the Open Document Format version of it, showed a lot of screen shots and a
   detailed survey of the settings and parameters of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  It
   inspired us to be even more thorough in describing \textsl{Yoshimi}, and
   then Will got involved to provide even more details.  Please note that this
   document also owes a lot to the descriptions and diagrams provided by the
   original \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} author, Paul Nasca, as well as some others
   whose names we do not have.

\subsection{Yoshimi Versus ZynAddSubFX}
\label{subsec:introduction_yoshimi_vs_zyn}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi},
   the software synthesizer derived from the great
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} \cite{zynaddsubfx} software
   synthesizer.  Because of their common origin, much of this document also
   applies to \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} and depends upon some \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}
   documentation and diagrams.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is an algorithmic MIDI software synthesizer for Linux.
   It synthesizes in real time, can run polyphonic or monophonic, with multiple
   simultaneous patches on one or more MIDI channels, and has broad microtonal
   capability. It includes extensive addititive, subtractive,
   and pad synth capabilities which can be run simultaneously within the
   same patch.  It also has eight audio effects modules.

   Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} (Copyright
   2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul), development of \textsl{Yoshimi} has
   continued for quite a while now in its own direction. These include
   major optimizations for audio and MIDI performance, and more recently
   progressive development of user-level and command-line access to all
   controls. At the same time, refinement continues, both visually and within
   the code.

   What are the advantages of
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versus \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}?
   At one time \textsl{Yoshimi} had better JACK support
   than \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}, but that is no longer true.
   Both projects are now in active development, and both are
   progressing along their respective roadmaps.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} currently has a slight revamped graphical user interface,
   while \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} has a major user-interface upgrade planned.
   Each project has some features and capabilities that the other lacks.
   There may be internal differences of importance to
   a developer, as well as features that aren't so easy to discover.  So,
   really, it is not clear that there is really a big advantage to one over the
   other... use them both and make your own decision!  Or just continue using
   both of them!

\subsection{New Features}
\label{subsec:introduction_new_features}

   This section provides an \textsl{ad hoc}, catch-as-catch-can survey of the
   new features of \textsl{Yoshimi}, in no particular order.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} can now run as an LV2 plugin.  Supported features:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item Sample-accurate MIDI timing.
      \item State save/restore support via \textsl{LV2\_State\_Interface}.
      \item Working UI support via \textsl{LV2\_External\_UI\_Widget}.
      \item Programs interface support via \textsl{LV2\_Programs\_Interface}.
      \item Multi-channel audio output.
         'outl' and 'outr' have lv2 index 2 and 3.
         All individual ports numbers start at 4.
   \end{enumber}

   A planned feature:
   Controls automation support.
   This will be a part of a common controls interface.

   Sensitivity to MIDI volume change (CC \#7) is now variable in 'Controllers' in
   the same way as pan width, etc. The numeric range is 64 to 127; the default
   at 96 gives the same sensitivity as before at -12dB relative to the GUI
   controls.  127 gives 0dB and 64 gives -26dB.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} now stamps instrument and patch set XML files with its own
   major and minor version numbers so it is possible to tell which version
   created the files, or whether they were created by \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.

   It is now possible to direct messages to either \texttt{stderr}
   (the error output of a terminal console) or the report window
   on the fly. If one chooses \texttt{stderr}, the \textbf{Reports} button is
   greyed out.

   Some NRPNs are now supported.
   See the new NRPN sections.

   One can now use the mouse scroll wheel to adjust rotary controls. Holding
   down the Ctrl key gives access to finer adjustment.  Also, horizontal as
   well as vertical mouse movement will adjust the knob.

   Part-editing windows carry the part number and voice name in the title bar.
   For the AddSynth oscillator window this also includes the voice number.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} now can provide  up to 64 parts, in blocks of 16. One can
   now decide how many one wants to have available using the spin-box alongside
   the channel number.  One can have 16, 32 or 64 parts.  By default, all the
   upper parts are mapped to the same MIDI channel numbers as the lowest ones,
   but have independent voice and patch set values. They can not normally
   receive independent note or control messages. However, vector control will
   intelligently work with however many are set, as will all the NRPN direct
   part controls.

   When opening an instrument bank, one can now tell exactly which synth
   engines are used by each instrument. This is represented by three pale
   background colours: Red = AddSynth; Blue = SubSynth; and Green = PadSynth.

   If the instruments are kits they scanned to find out if any member of the
   kit contains each engine, so that the colors above can be applied.
   This feature is duplicated in the current part, the mixer panel for the
   currently loaded instruments, and in the Instrument Edit window.
   The same colors highlight the engine names when they are enabled with the
   check boxes. 

   Bank root directories are better identified, with IDs that can be changed by
   the user in the GUI. This is also made available for selecting over MIDI.
   MIDI only sees banks in the \textsl{current}
   \textbf{root} directory, but all banks are accessible to the GUI.

   It is now possible to set up a new bank root path when starting from the
   command line. This takes the form:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ yoshimi -D /home/(username)/(directory)/(subdirectory)/bank
   \end{verbatim}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} will then immediately scan this path for new banks, but
   won't make the root (or any of its banks) current. The final directory
   doesn't in fact have to be 'banks', but, traditionally, we have always done
   this.

   Also, when running from the command line there is now access to many of the
   system and root, bank, and other settings.

	\textsl{Yoshimi} now splits out roots and banks from the main configuration
	file, and also creates a new histories file. The separation means that the
	different functions can be implemented, saved, and loaded at the most
   appropriate time. These files have
   "yoshimi" as the doctype, as they are in no way relevant to
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.
   See the new Banks sections.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} now remembers where major windows were last placed (per
   instance), and if any were left open at shutdown, they will be reopened at
   the same location on the next run.

   To help when things don't seem to go right, one can now show 'raw' incoming
   CCs. This is enabled from the 'MIDI' tab in 'Settings'. These are the values
   before \textsl{Yoshimi} does any processing.

   Thanks to the \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} developers, \textsl{Yoshimi} now has pink
   as well as white noise available on Addsynth voices. Pink noise sounds
   'softer'.

   The preferred JACK/ALSA MIDI and audio connections are no longer fixed at
   compile time. There are now checkboxes on 'Settings' to change them.

   With the latest 'depop' port from \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}, \textsl{Yoshimi}
   is now fully compatibly with all instrument files.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} will now always start even if the audio/MIDI backend called
   for doesn't exist. In this situation it will try all combinations in the
   order JACK, ALSA, and null. This enables one to then change the settings and
   try again.

   One can also set 'preferred' startup ALSA/JACK/MIDI and audio devices.
   These selections will be remembered on the next run.

   MIDI program changes have always been pretty clean from the time Cal first
   introduced them, but now GUI changes are just as clean. While it is
   generally best to change a program when the part is silent, even if a part
   is sounding there is usually barely a click. There is no interference at all
   with any other sounding parts.

   Sometimes MIDI CCs don't seem to give the results one expects. There is
   now a setting that will report all incoming CCs so that one can discover
   what \textsl{Yoshimi} actually sees (which may not be what was expected).

   At the request of one user, \textsl{Yoshimi} now has an
   implementation of CC2, Breath Control.
   \index{breath control}
   \index{new!breath control}
   This feature combines volume with
   filter cutoff.

   The 'Humanise' feature has had more interest so it's been upgraded. It's now
   a slider and it's setting can be saved in patch sets. It provides a tiny
   per-note random detune to an \textsl{entire} part (all engines in all kits),
   but only for that part.

   Audio and MIDI preferences have been improved. If one sets (say) ALSA MIDI
   and JACK audio, either from the GUI or the command line, the setting can be
   saved and will be reinstated on the next run. These settings are
   per-instance, so if one has multiple sound cards, one can make full use of
   them.

   Barring major system failures, there are now no circumstances where Yoshimi
   will fail to start.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is now verified as being able to use the 192000 Hz sample
   rate in both ALSA and JACK - if one has a suitable soundcard!

   There is greater control of one's working environment. One can have just the
   GUI, just a CLI or both, and these settings can be saved. If one tries to
   disable both, one will get a polite warning and will be left with just the
   CLI.

   The CLI can now access almost all top level controls as well as the 'main
   page' part ones and can select any effect and effect preset, but can't yet
   deal with the individual effects controls. It can be used to set up Vector
   Control much more quickly and easily than using NRPNs.  The CLI is also
   context sensitive, which, along with careful choice of command names and
   abreviations, allows very fast access with minimal typing.

   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s parser is case-insensitive for commands (but not for
   filenames), and accepts the shortest unambiguous abbreviation. However it is
   quite pedantic, and expects spelling to be correct regardless of length.
   Apart from the 'back' commands, it is word-based so spaces are significant.

   Some examples:

   "\texttt{s p 4 pr 6}" (set part 4 program 6):
   This command sets part 4 to the instrument with ID 6 from the current bank.
   It also then leaves one at the part context level and pointed to part 4.
   Additionally, it will activate that part if it was off (and the
   configuration setting is checked). In most cases the words 'program' and
   'instrument' are interchangable.

   "\texttt{s ef 1 ty rev}":
   This command moves one up to part effects context level and sets that part's
   effect number 1 to effect type 'reverb'.

   "\texttt{s pre 2}":
   This command sets preset number 2 (we use numbers here as most preset names
   repeat the effect type).

   "\texttt{..s 6 v 80}":
   This command drops one back up to part level, switches one to part 6, and
   sets its volume to 80 (but doesn't actually enable it).

   "\texttt{/s ve cc 93}":
   This command drops back up to the top level, and sets vector control for
   channel 0, X axis to respond to CC 93 leaving one in the vector context.

   Whenever intermediate values are omitted, the default or last-used value
   will be assumed, and all counting starts from zero.  The CLI prompt always
   shows what level one is on, and the help lists are also partly
   context-sensitive, so one doesn't see a lot of irrelevent clutter.  There is
   more, and a lot more to come!  While doing all this work, we've also ensured
   that \textsl{Yoshimi} instrument patches are still fully compatible with
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} patches, and have now ported across the new refinements
   with thanks.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document is a struggle.  No matter which route is
   taken, there's no way to avoid jumping all over this document to
   adequately cover a topic.  Therefore, the sections are basically provided
   in the order their contents appear in the user interface of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  To help the reader jump around this document, multiple
   links and references are supplied.

   \index{tips!in document}
   Usage tips
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tip:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   \index{bugs!in document}
   Bug notes
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Yoshimi} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "Bug:".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "bugs".

   \index{new!in document}
   New features
   since the last version are flagged with "New:"  We cannot pretend to have
   marked all new developments, as \textsl{Yoshimi} is advancing fast.

   \index{todo!in document}
   TODO items are also present, in the same vein.  This document currently has
   a number of them!

\subsection{Yoshimi Mailing List}
\label{subsec:introduction_mailing_list}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} project used to have an email listserv at
   SourceForge, but the unreliability of the site has prompted a move to a
   new mailing list.  See reference \cite{yoshiminews}.  The team have
   managed to port across all the old yoshimi-user archives to this new
   site.  See reference \cite{yoshiminewsarchive}.

   Subscribe to the \textsl{Yoshimi} mailing list with an e-mail to:
   \url{yoshimi-request@freelists.org} or by visiting

\subsection{Yoshimi Licensing}
\label{subsec:introduction_yoshimi_licensing}

   Before we get started, one more thing.

   \begin{quotation}
      Software licenses are are something I \textsl{really}
      don't want to get involved in - I have much better things to do with my
      time - but I found I was obliged to do so.

      It is possible I'm the only person who knows all the following events, as
      I was the one that instigated them!

      The first time I saw ZynAddSubFX source files they were licensed as GPL
      V2. At that time Zyn had a number of very serious problems, and not much
      was being done about them. Somewhat naively I asked Lars Luthman if he
      would help, as he had offered a couple of small patches previously. His
      response was that he would not do any significant work, as he did not
      agree with the GPL V2 only license.

      I then contacted Paul, explaining the situation and asking if he would
      consider a change in the license to V2 or later. I was actually a bit
      surprised that he immediately agreed. When I next looked at the sources,
      the licenses on the files had indeed been updated, so I passed this
      information on.

      Unfortunately Paul forgot to update the website, but I wasn't especially
      concerned as it was only the files themselves that really mattered.

      While developing Yoshimi after the initial fork, Cal queried the license
      situation. I told him of the conversations I'd had, and passed him a copy
      of the email I'd got from Paul. Later on, Cal - in good faith - wrote new
      sources and placed them under GPL V3. This would be quite compatible with
      V2 or later, but not with V2 strict.

      What I didn't notice until very much later was that Paul had only updated
      half of the text in the sources, leaving the actual licence in an
      ambiguous state.

      To the best of my knowledge, V3 is not compatible with V2 strict, but V2
      or later is. However the \textsl{complete}
      project then becomes downgraded to V2
      strict - although the V2 or later sources (such as all the new root/bank
      code) can independently be freely merged into V3 code.

      I doubt anyone would actually make an issue of this. However, to safeguard
      Yoshimi as a whole, I took it upon myself to change Cal's code to V2 or
      later. I believe it retains the spirit of his wishes, and the only person
      with standing to object -- his daughter - has been totally supportive of
      the work currently being done on Yoshimi.

      Any source code I add will be GPL V2 or later.

      Update.

      The original change discussion has now been located and the license for
      both Zyn and Yoshi is confirmed as GPL V2 or later.

      Anyone wanting to confirm this should look at the Zyn user list archives
      August 2007 and September 2007.
   \end{quotation}

\subsection{Let's Get Started with Yoshimi!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Yoshimi}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK}, which
   complicates the discussion of \textsl{Yoshimi}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Yoshimi} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Yoshimi} so that it uses ALSA for audio and ALSA for
   MIDI.  See \sectionref{sec:yoshimi_man_page}.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ yoshimi -a -A
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Yosh-splash-OTW-1.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Splash Screen!}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen}
\end{figure}

   One sees a brief message, and then the splash screen.
   We show the splash screen, \figureref{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen},
   here because it goes away too fast when one runs \textsl{Yoshimi}!
   What fun is that?

   Next shown is the \textsl{Yoshimi} main window,
   as shown in \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen},
   and it persists, of course:

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{1.3.8/yoshimi-first-screen.jpg}
   \caption{Yoshimi Main Screen, 1.3.8 and Above}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}
\end{figure}

   For this manual, we describe the main window as being composed of
   the following sections:

\begin{enumber}
   \item \textbf{Menu}.
   \item \textbf{Top Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Effects Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Bottom Panel}.  Includes the VU-meter at the bottom.
\end{enumber}

   There's a lot going on with \textsl{Yoshimi}, and there's no way to describe
   it in linear order.  This manual will describe how to do useful things in
   each of the sections noted above, while leaving some of the details to be
   described in later sections, to which reference can be made for the details.
   This document depends heavily on index entries and references.
   There is also a "cookbook" at \cite{book}, but it is a long way from being
   comprehensive.  Check it out anyway.

   Finally, if one grabs the latest source code for \textsl{Yoshimi}, in the
   'examples' directory there is a complete song set, 'OutThere.mid' and
   'OutThere.xmz'. Together these produce a fairly complex 12 part tune that
   makes \textsl{Yoshimi} work quite hard.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

   In summary, we can say that you will absolutely love \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   There are some topics that this document does not yet treat:

      \begin{itemize}
         \item Changing the colors and style of the GUI, as seen in some
            versions of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  This does not yet seem possible,
            because the synth part is not truly separate from the GUI, and the
            \textsl{Yoshimi} developers have not found it easy to recode the
            FLTK GUI.
      \end{itemize}

   \begin{quotation}
      A car analogy.

      A sample player is a drive along a straight, wide, almost new highway
      with only 2 other cars in sight, on a lightly overcast summer's day in a
      Ford Fiesta at around 40 MPH.

      Yoshimi is a white-knuckle trip over a Swiss mountain pass in a blizzard,
      at night, facing donkeys, trucks and bandits, while driving an open-frame
      kit car doing 90 +

      In recent times we've been able to dispose of the donkeys, and the
      bandits are on the run :)
   \end{quotation}

   Although we must admit the new Fiesta are actually pretty slick and fast!
