Yoshimi User Manual Document v. 2.2.0
Chris Ahlstrom and Will Godfrey
2015-04-20 to 2022-05-09

This project provides two things:

   1. An advanced user manual, always in progress, but extremely complete, to
      cover just about everything to do with Yoshimi.  Tips, bug notes, and
      "to-do's" are also included.

   2. A safe place for notes, banks, presets, and other material
      discovered while using Yoshimi.  Some of this material has
      since disappeared from where I first got it.

Mostly maintained by Will Godfrey, who has carried on the Yoshimi project.

Now, if you see your material in this project, and want me to take it
out, just send me a mailto:ahlstromcj@gmail.com and I will comply
after verifying you provide that material somewhere.

To recreate the PDF file (the latest version is always available in the "pdf"
directory), you will need to install GNU make, latexmk, tex-live, pdf2latex,
and other resources related to LaTeX and PDF support.  If everything is in
place, then change to the "tex" directory, and a simple "make" command will
create the document.  "make clean" in the "tex" directory will remove all of
the generated products.

Actually, both "make" and "make clean" are now supported from the top-level
of the project, for convenience, and "make" archives the PDF file if the
build succeeds.

Lastly, although this manual is much larger than any other I have seen,
there is still much to be done to make it complete, readable, and easy to
use.  Any help or suggestions are quite welcome!

Build dependencies:

To build the document, you need to install packages like the following:

    -   latexmk.  Provides a way to make the PDF document with a "make"
        command.
    -   texlive-latex-base.
    -   pdflatex.
    -   Ghostscript.  Usefu for optimizing the PDF to make it a lot smaller.
        But it seems to break the internal document hyperlinks.

This list might be incomplete.
