Yoshimi User Manual Document v. 1.5.2

2015-04-20 to 2017-06-10

This project provides two things:

   1. A document, still in progress, to cover just about everything
      to do with Yoshimi, with some material covering ZynAddSubFX as
      well.  Tips, bug notes, and "to-do's" are also included.

   2. A safe place for notes, banks, presets, and other material I have
      discovered while using Yoshimi.  Some of this material has
      since disappeared from where I first got it.

Now, if you see your material in this project, and want me to take it
out, just send me a mailto:ahlstromcj@gmail.com and I will comply
after verifying you provide that material somewhere.

To recreate the PDF file (the latest version is always available in the "pdf"
directory), you will need to install GNU make, latexmk, tex-live, pdf2latex,
and other resources related to LaTeX and PDF support.  If everything is in
place, then change to the "tex" directory, and a simple "make" command will
create the document.

"make clean" in the "tex" directory will remove all of the generated
products.

Actually, both "make" and "make clean" are now supported from the top-level
of the project, for convenience, and "make" archives the PDF file if the
build succeeds.

Lastly, although this manual is much larger than any other I have seen,
there is still much to be done to make it complete, readable, and easy to
use.  Any help or suggestions are quite welcome!

Build dependencies:

To build the document, you need to install packages like the following:

    -   latexmk.  Provides a way to make the PDF document with a "make"
        command.
    -   texlive-latex-base.
    -   pdflatex.

This list might be incomplete, still working on it.
