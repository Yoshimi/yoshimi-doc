This is a sample user-configuration directory for Yoshimi.
The user can store configuration, song files, sound files, presents, banks,
and other Yoshimi-related files anywhere.

But here, we provide a directory that might fit perfectly well in
your own ~/.config/yoshimi directory.

Oddly, one of the state files is compressed XML, and the other is
uncompressed XML.
