Hi Chris,

I've created more work for you :)

In the master version there are significant extensions to the NRPNs that Yoshimi
handles. Some of these may seem pointless... unless you are unable to use a GUI
for some reason. It's likely I'll make another release (1.3.6) very soon.

There's information in the doc folder, but do shout if you have any questions.

Also we now have a email list separate from sourceforge, but have managed to
port across all the old yoshimi-user archives.

You can subscribe with an e-mail to: yoshimi-request@freelists.org
or by visiting: http://www.freelists.org/list/yoshimi

To post to the list, email to: yoshimi@freelists.org

Our archive is at: https://www.freelists.org/archive/yoshimi

Subject: Yoshimi notes
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

I've just had another look through the epic! work you're doing on the manual.
Here are some clarifications (not in any special order).

x There has been a lot of re-organisation of Yoshimi->settings. The CC tab is now
  named MIDI.

x Curiously named period size, is now where it should be in main settings and
  called internal buffer (which is what it really is).

x Oscillator size is now called AddSynth Oscillator size, to make it clear what
  it really is.

NOTE The command line help menu has also been updated.

x Using XML compression can save file access time which may be beneficial if
  your machine is borderline on latency.


In the Alsa menu

x The purpose of Alsa Midi Device is the same as the command line
  --alsa-midi="{name}" and is so that Yoshi can auto connect to a MIDI source
  such as a keyboard. The one I have here identifies itself as Hua Xing.

x Similarly Alsa Audio lets you connect to a sound card by name. In my case,
  with a Komplete Audio KA 6 the command is hw:K6. This is particularly
  useful for USB modules, as you can never be sure where they will appear
  numerically.

x From V 1.3.6 onwards (and current master) what using alsa audio Yoshi first
  tries to connect 2 channels at 32 bit depth, but negotiates with whatever
  the soundcard will support. In my case that. 24bit 6 channel (but Yoshi
  only' uses 1&2)

x At one time you could in theory have 1000 roots, 1000 banks and 1000 presets.
  This is ludicrous! Roots and banks were trimmed to what can be addressed
  from MIDI, but you can still have 1000 presets, not that I've ever tried to
  prove it!  To paraphrase, 2,621,440 instruments is enough for anyone!
  (128x128x160).

x Refreshes have been removed because they are no longer needed. The code self
  syncs better.

x You can't reach root paths through the Yoshimi->settings window any more - it
  was causing a nightmare of syncing with the other entry routes. You can
  reach it from the Instrument tab, or the Banks window or the Instruments
  window, both of the latter also have multiple entry routes!

y It's probably best to more clearly separate the concept of parts V channels
  these days. There are only 16 MIDI channels, there are up to 64 parts each of
  which can be on any channel or disabled :)

Part audio destination (jack) is saved with the parameter sets, so is the number
of available parts. Zyn will still load these but ignores any settings it
doesn't recognise. If you re-save in Zyn, the settings will be lost.

Zyn, and older versions of Yoshi it's possibly to end up with un-named
instruments. Since V 1.3.4 Yoshi will trap such an occurrence and name it 'No
Title'. Yoshi won't let you save the unedited default sound!

In parameter sets Yoshi will save named but disabled patches. Zyn doesn't. Be
aware of that!

It is advisable to copy all the default Banks to userspace so you can them
re-arrange edit and add to them easily. Just keep the default for emergency
recovery.

Un-numbered instruments in a bank will be given a 'temporary ID starting from
number 160 and working down. If those numbers already exist then they will be
skipped over. This can get very confusing! However, if you simply load it
and re-save it to the same slot it will gain that ID and be properly fixed.
You can the move-swap it with others.

All Root, bank instrument IDs are used by MIDI controls, and as of V 1.3.6 will
also be accessible to the command line.

We no longer say anything about Yoshi being better at alsa/jack implementation.
It's no longer true. Performance-wise the two are neck-an-neck these days,
although there is one special case where yoshi dramatically out performs Zyn.
I've only recently discovered this and don't want to say anything more until
I've discussed it with Mark.


Subsynth sliders.
The top row sets the *relative* amplitude. This is an important distinction as
the overall level is normalised, so all actual levels will be dependent on
whichever is the highest.

The bottom row sets the bandwidth of each harmonic. If you have just the
fundamental and drop the bandwith to minimum you get very nearly a sinewave.
Set it to maximum and it is very obviously filtered noise!


The part effects layout was changed at the request of people at LAC2015. it now
more closely matches the appearance of system and insertion effects.

As of V 1.3.6 the splash screen stays up a bit longer, and gives more
information if it has a problem.

New instance with alsa audio - yes we know! haven't worked out a sensible fix
yet :(

state V parameters
State saves *everything* parameters saves everything that is relevant to that
collection of sounds... That's the theory. I must recheck this sometime :)

Saving settings or not.
If you change settings and close without saving that means they remain in
place only for the current session. If you've changed anything, when you close
Yoshi you will be given a second chance to save them. If you say 'no' the next
time you start, the old settings will be restored. I did think of creating an
'undo' feature but it gets pretty crazy very quickly.

The new coloured engine backgrounds aren't just pretty. They give real
information about expected processor load, and time to be ready when loaded.

Processor low to high, Pad, Sub, Add.
Time low to high, Sub, Add, Pad.

Default master volume is 90, part is 96 add (overall) sub, pad is 90, addvoice
is 100, effects are all over the place - don't ask me why!

Phew!

Hi Chris,                                                                         
                                                                                  
The latest 'master' version on github carries the version number 1.3.6 rc2.       
However, there is new branch called 'command' which has all the latest            
command-line additions and this will *probably* be merged into 1.3.6 unless       
something really bad is lurking in there. I've reverted to C style string         
handling for this. I find it much easier to get *exactly* what I want :(

For what it's worth I've been using this synth since Zyn 2.2.1 and am *still*
finding out new things about it!


I've had a quick look at the cookbook and you're doing very well there. But
don't forget that Yoshi really picks up her skirts and runs when creating
sounds that have no real-world analog at all!


Good news on Sequencer24. I'll try to find time to give it a run.
