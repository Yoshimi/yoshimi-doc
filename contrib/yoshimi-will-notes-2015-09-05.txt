Subject: Yoshimi updates.
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

I've created more work for you :)

In the master version there are significant extensions to the NRPNs that Yoshimi
handles. Some of these may seem pointless... unless you are unable to use a GUI
for some reason. It's likely I'll make another release (1.3.6) very soon.

There's information in the doc folder, but do shout if you have any questions.

Also we now have a email list separate from sourceforge, but have managed to
port across all the old yoshimi-user archives.

You can subscribe with an e-mail to: yoshimi-request@freelists.org
or by visiting: http://www.freelists.org/list/yoshimi

Subject: Yoshimi notes
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

I've just had another look through the epic! work you're doing on the manual.
Here are some clarifications (not in any special order).

x There has been a lot of re-organisation of Yoshimi->settings. The CC tab is now
named MIDI.

x Curiously named period size, is now where it should be in main settings and
called internal buffer (which is what it really is).

x Oscillator size is now called AddSynth Oscillator size, to make it clear what
it really is.

NOTE The command line help menu has also been updated.

x Using XML compression can save file access time which may be beneficial if
your machine is borderline on latency.


In the Alsa menu

x The purpose of Alsa Midi Device is the same as the command line
--alsa-midi="{name}" and is so that Yoshi can auto connect to a MIDI source
such as a keyboard. The one I have here identifies itself as Hua Xing.

x Similarly Alsa Audio lets you connect to a sound card by name. In my case,
with a Komplete Audio KA 6 the command is hw:K6. This is particularly
useful for USB modules, as you can never be sure where they will appear
numerically.

x From V 1.3.6 onwards (and current master) what using alsa audio Yoshi first
tries to connect 2 channels at 32 bit depth, but negotiates with whatever
the soundcard will support. In my case that. 24bit 6 channel (but Yoshi
only' uses 1&2)

x At one time you could in theory have 1000 roots, 1000 banks and 1000 presets.
This is ludicrous! Roots and banks were trimmed to what can be addressed
from MIDI, but you can still have 1000 presets, not that I've ever tried to
prove it!To paraphrase, 2,621,440 instruments is enough for anyone!
(128x128x160).

x Refreshes have been removed because they are no longer needed. The code self
syncs better.

x You can't reach root paths through the Yoshimi->settings window any more - it
was causing a nightmare of syncing with the other entry routes. You can
reach it from the Instrument tab, or the Banks window or the Instruments
window, both of the latter also have multiple entry routes!

y It's probably best to more clearly separate the concept of parts V channels
these days. There are only 16 MIDI channels, there are up to 64 parts each of
which can be on any channel or disabled :)

x Part audio destination (jack) is saved with the parameter sets, so is the number
of available parts. Zyn will still load these but ignores any settings it
doesn't recognise. If you re-save in Zyn, the settings will be lost.

x Zyn, and older versions of Yoshi it's possibly to end up with un-named
instruments. Since V 1.3.4 Yoshi will trap such an occurrence and name it 'No
Title'. Yoshi won't let you save the unedited default sound!

x In parameter sets Yoshi will save named but disabled patches. Zyn doesn't. Be
aware of that!

x It is advisable to copy all the default Banks to userspace so you can them
re-arrange edit and add to them easily. Just keep the default for emergency
recovery.

x Un-numbered instruments in a bank will be given a 'temporary ID starting from
number 160 and working down. If those numbers already exist then they will be
skipped over. This can get very confusing! However, if you simply load it
and re-save it to the same slot it will gain that ID and be properly fixed.
You can the move-swap it with others.

x All Root, bank instrument IDs are used by MIDI controls, and as of V 1.3.6 will
also be accessible to the command line.

x We no longer say anything about Yoshi being better at alsa/jack
implementation.It's no longer true. Performance-wise the two are
neck-an-neck these days, although there is one special case where yoshi
dramatically out performs Zyn.I've only recently discovered this and
don't want to say anything more until I've discussed it with Mark.


x Subsynth sliders.
The top row sets the *relative* amplitude. This is an important distinction as
the overall level is normalised, so all actual levels will be dependent on
whichever is the highest.

x The bottom row sets the bandwidth of each harmonic. If you have just the
fundamental and drop the bandwith to minimum you get very nearly a sinewave.
Set it to maximum and it is very obviously filtered noise!

x The part effects layout was changed at the request of people at LAC2015. it now
more closely matches the appearance of system and insertion effects.

n As of V 1.3.6 the splash screen stays up a bit longer, and gives more
information if it has a problem.

New instance with alsa audio - yes we know! haven't worked out a sensible fix
yet :(

x state V parameters
State saves *everything* parameters saves everything that is relevant to that
collection of sounds... That's the theory. I must recheck this sometime :)

x Saving settings or not.
If you change settings and close without saving that means they remain in
place only for the current session. If you've changed anything, when you close
Yoshi you will be given a second chance to save them. If you say 'no' the next
time you start, the old settings will be restored. I did think of creating an
'undo' feature but it gets pretty crazy very quickly.

x The new coloured engine backgrounds aren't just pretty. They give real
information about expected processor load, and time to be ready when loaded.
Processor low to high, Pad, Sub, Add.
Time low to high, Sub, Add, Pad.

x Default master volume is 90, part is 96 add (overall) sub, pad is 90, addvoice
is 100, effects are all over the place - don't ask me why!

Phew!

Hi Chris,

The latest 'master' version on github carries the version number 1.3.6 rc2.
However, there is new branch called 'command' which has all the latest
command-line additions and this will *probably* be merged into 1.3.6 unless
something really bad is lurking in there. I've reverted to C style string
handling for this. I find it much easier to get *exactly* what I want :(

New files in doc:
x Command_line.txt
x Dynamic_System_Settings.txt
x Yoshimi_1/3/6-features.txt

Significantly updated files:

Direct_Part_Control
NewFeatures.txt
Vector_Control.txt

Minor updates:
Using_NRPNs.txt

For what it's worth I've been using this synth since Zyn 2.2.1 and am *still*
finding out new things about it!

I've had a quick look at the cookbook and you're doing very well there. But
don't forget that Yoshi really picks up her skirts and runs when creating
sounds that have no real-world analog at all!

Good news on Sequencer24. I'll try to find time to give it a run.

You have my sympathy :)

However once you get to grips with the UI it's actually pretty consistent.

That's not a bug. It's intended. It's part of the anti-clutter feature of those
windows. In the same way, if you right click on banks or roots it closes one
window as it opens the other.

Open the panel window and it's just above the Edit button of each part. You
have Main, Part or both.

P.S.
Right click on the edit button and you actually open the instrument edit
window, otherwise it just selects it as the current part.

Also any click in the part label opens the current instrument window.

To a degree we try not to change things in an unexpected way. Old Yoshi, and
Zyn don't give you the option at all. We also try to keep a pleasing visual
balance so couldn't increase the width by much. Also, we already use a very
small font for that button. To get two words in you'd need a magnifier :(

Ummmm :)

We did think about making a right click open the name editor instead (like it
does in the top level) but I think that got a bit complicated and it was
abandoned.

Just remembered something.
When using rotary controls. Left mouse button move gives coarse control, right
button gives fine control. The scroll wheel gives better control than moving
the mouse, and if you hold down the ctrl key at the same time the control is
*extremely* fine.

For vertical sliders only, if you hold down the right mouse button then move it
slightly the peg will go to it's default position. the same will happen if you
click on the track with the right button - bet you never knew that :)

Hi Chris,

A little clarification,

In the settings window, 'Save Settings' refers to the entire window, not just
individual tabs. The close buttons are actually outside the frame of the tabs.

Also 'Close without saving' doesn't mean revert to previous settings, it means
use the changes but don't immediately store them to the filesystem.

Oh, and there are a few more bits in the 'command' branch :)

A frame is a single sample of however many channels you are handling, so if you
are using jack, a mono signal will have frames of 1 float, 2 for stereo etc.

ALSA is more complex as it handles pretty much the sound card's format,
commonly ints, 24 bit ints (low byte ignored), and short ints. Less commonly
it may be floats or the weird 24 L ints. I'm still not sure if these are packed
or low aligned (top byte ignored). I've assumed they are low aligned, but I
don't know anyone who has such a card in order to prove it. As a matter of
interest the only ALSA format yoshi doesn't support is float - again, no way
to test it.

The new command line entry system has proved stable enough to move to 'master'.

Meanwhile we are working in a different implementation in 'command' that
eventually should be much better and more easily extended. At the moment there

OK, unless anyone comes up with a serious objection or alternative, for V1.3.6
in the gui, and in all notes 'Parameter' will become 'Patch Set' (exactly the
same number of characters), so obviously 'Parameters' changes to 'Patch Sets'.

There will be no changes in the code, nor in any XML files.

This is only a small detail, but these things add up. If you see any other
wording that's obscure, I'm quite happy to look at it.

Something that's not obvious is the way that ALSA audio is controlled and who
takes command.

If you set a specific destination then Yoshimi says what it wants. It's often a
negotiation on bit depth and channel count, but Yoshimi nearly always gets
to decide the buffer size (it will be set to internal buffer size). However if
the destination is 'default' then ALSA decides on the sound card, bit depth,
number of channels and the buffer size - Yoshimi will set it's internal
buffer size to match. On my machines this always seems to be 1024.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Over the last few days I've been doing some extensive testing of the current
master, including LV2 - something I don't normally use. My test file was one
that performed full bank and program setup from a midi source file as well as
volume and pan settings. However, I made an unfortunate discovery.

If Yoshimi's internal buffer is *smaller* than the jack buffer it sounds quite
horrible. If it's the same or greater there's no problem. The reason I didn't
find this before is that it only affects Yoshimi LV2. Also it doesn't apply to
any of the released versions.

The cause of the problem is that the LV2 code doesn't have the same looping
structure that was added to the standalone routine to deal with exactly this
situation (re-entering the audio 'construction' function until the jack buffer
is filled). I'm hoping Andrew can deal with this fairly soon as I don't
understand the LV2 code very well.

There are valid reasons for wanting different sizes for these buffers. The
internal buffer size as well as affecting latency and CPU load also alters the
sound in quite subtle ways. It particularly affects the behaviour of filters.
One day we may be able to stop this happening, but in the mean time we have to
live with it. For my purposes I find a buffer size of 128 or 256 is best.

So there we are. We have a problem. You can get round it, but I'm reluctant to
make the next release until it's fixed :(


Moving on from that, I was testing using the latest versions of Ardour, Muse
and Qtractor as LV2 hosts. I also tried Carla but couldn't get anywhere with it
at all - if someone is familiar with it I'd be interested in what results
they get. 


Slightly to my surprise the one that performed the best in every respect was
Qtractor. Muse got everything correct, but was prone to Xruns on program
changes. Ardour was very problematical. There were no Xruns but it seemed to
have odd timing issues. Also, on two occasions it managed to shorten the decay
times of two of the instruments. I don't understand how it managed that.

My reference was the original midi file played into a stand-alone Yoshimi via
aplaymidi. This also behaves identically to the file being sequenced by
Rosegarden.

We have one known outstanding issue, but it's not a show-stopper and there is a
lot of good things there - including quite extensive command line access.

Please have a look at the current master version (rc5). There is a combination
of internal buffer size and jack buffer size that can give LFO and envelope
timing errors but only (it seems) for the latest version of one LV2 host.

If anyone feels like looking at this, let me know and I'll give further details.

To all practical purposes the current master *is* V 1.3.6 (even identifies as
such). This evening I'll put the tarball on sourceforge, and write up the notes.

For a sneak preview, in 'doc' look at 'Command_Line.txt' and
'Yoshimi_1.3.6-features.txt'.

The information on ALSA has been updated in 'ALSA_Setup.txt' and
'Dynamic_System_Settings.txt' gives some information on the extended NRPNs.

P.S.
Yoshimi is a continuous learning process. I'm *still* finding out things I
didn't know about it!

P.P.S
Changelog gives you a blow-by-blow account of the nitty-gritty.

Subject: [yoshimi] Yoshimi V1.3.6 - At last!
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

All known issues have been fixed, but I'm not going to be so stupid as to say
there are no others :)

Anyway, please do download and have a play with this - especially the new
command line options. It needs a good shake-down to find out what works best.

The obligatory blurb...

One of the main features of this release is improved accessibility. The
effectiveness (and indeed usefulness) of this will help shape future
complimentary interfaces. Also, a number of first-time defaults have been
changed to make this easier.

It has always been possible to run Yoshimi headless, but now real control is
available. In the first place, when starting from the command line, an argument
can be included for a new root path to be defined to point to a set of banks
fetched from elsewhere. This will be given the next free ID.

Once running, almost all dynamic setup (i.e. doesn't require a restart) can now
be done within the terminal window. There is also extensive control of roots,
banks, parts and instruments including the ability to list and set all of
these. You can now do things like:

Path add /home/music/yoshimi/banks
Set part 4 program 130

Additional controls that are frequently taken forgranted in the GUI but
otherwise get forgotten are master key shift and master volume.

Finally, we have the most important parts of vector control exposed to the
command line.

For all of this there is extensive error checking and feedback.

In parallel with this there are more NRPNs so that you can perform some of
these via automation. That arrangment looks positively steam-punk, but is
actually very easy to use, requiring only a utility that can send MIDI CCs.
NRPNs aren't special. They are simply a specific pattern of CCs. Yoshimi's
implementation is very forgiving, doesn't mind if you stop halfway through
(will just get on with other things while it waits) and will report exactly
what it is doing.

Another significant improvement is to the handling of ALSA audio, which is
still very important for some people. Up till now we've been insisting on 2
channel 16 bit format. Tests have shown that virtually all motherboard sound
chipsets will handle this, but many external ones don't. So now we initially
request 32 bit 2 channel and work towards a compromise :) With external sound
modules in mind, endian swaps are also implemented. 
Vector control has been extended so that there are four independent 'features'
that each axis can control, One is fixed as volume (if enabled) but the others
can be any valid CC and can also be reversed. The vector 'sweep' CCs are split
out very early in the MIDI chain and the new CCs created are fed back in before
any other processing. The result of this is that once we eventually get
MIDI-learn implimented the control posibilities will expand dramatically -
sorry about the extreme delay :(

When using the GUI, there are additional style improvements and tweaks. Also,
Yoshimi is a bit more informative when there are insurmountable problems,
especially at start-up.

In the 'examples' directory there is now a complete song set, 'OutThere.mid'
and 'OutThere.xmz'. Together these produce a fairly complex 12 part tune that
makes Yoshimi work quite hard.

Finally, as well as document updates and the usual crop of bug-blatting, a
couple of obscure regressions have been fixed.

Having had some time to actually look at these (after the bugfix) I realise
the entire concept is in fact very powerful.

Absolutely everything that has blue C P buttons can be stored in the presets
directory. That includes entire Addsynth engines! Also, when you look at the
copy/paste buffer, you only see items that are relevant to the group that the C
P buttons are in.

As you want to be able to save as well as load these presets, it makes sense to
copy all the default ones to a location such as .config/yoshimi/presets. That
makes them fully accessible, but tucked away out of sight. Possibly I could set
up yoshimi to create this directory at first time start up.

The directory structure is the same as the *old* bank roots so I'm thinking of
changing that. There is the same problem that if you have several preset
directories with the same named preset you'll see all of them together, with no
idea where they came from. If I change that so you only see and manage items in
a *current* directory I think that will be more manageable.
