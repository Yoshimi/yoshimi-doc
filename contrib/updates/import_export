The command line now has two commands to provide access to the new bank export and import controls. These are top level controls and are used as below.

\begin{verbatim}
  EXport [s <n1>] <n2> <s>
\end{verbatim}

This is used to export a bank. The square bracket term is optional an enables one to select a different root to export from and would be in the form:

\begin{verbatim}
  EXport Root (root ID number) (bank ID number) (full path name to export to)
\end{verbatim}

If one is happy to export from the currently selected root, then this simplifes to:

\begin{verbatim}
  EXport (bank ID number) (full path name to export to)
\end{verbatim}

Importing uses identical syntax.

\begin{verbatim}
  IMport [s <n1>] <n2> <s>
\end{verbatim}

A full example using the normal abbeviations is:

\begin{verbatim}
  im r 5 25 /home/will/downloads/some new bank
\end{verbatim}

This will look for the directory "some new bank" (note: spaces are accepted) in the download directory of user "will". It will then copy it into bank number 25 of root number 5. It first checks to ensure that the new named bank exists, root 5 exists, and bank 25 is empty.
