Vector: [n1] (base channel)

  [X/Y] CC <n2>
This sets the incomming CC that will be recognised for control of the X or Y axis. X CC must be set before everything else. YCC must be set before any other Y controls.


  [X/Y] Features <n2> [s]
This sets the features for this axis and whether they are reversed.

  [X] PRogram <l/r> <n2>
This sets the X axis instruments from the current bank for LH or RH parts.

  [Y] PRogram <d/u> <n2>
This sets the Y axis instruments from the current bank for Down or Up parts.

  [X/Y] Control <n2> <n3>     - sets n3 CC to use for X or Y feature n2 (2-4)
This allows a change of the actual CC associated with features 2 to 4. They can be any CC that Yoshimi recognises.
