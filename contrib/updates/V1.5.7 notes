MIDI LEARN

If the Min and Max values in the editing window are the same then instead of a
range limit this becomes a switch threshold. If it's less than the value it is
regarded as Min, otherwise it's Max. To relate the theshold point to incoming
MIDI values, multiply it by 1.27

The actual Min or Max will be the minimum and maximim values of the selected
Yoshimi control. So for simple switches it will be 0 or 1, for 'ordinary'
controls it will be 0 or 127, and for multiple position switches it will be 0
or the highest numbered switch postion.

Maximim MIDI-learned lines is now 200.


NEW INSTRUMENT FORMAT

By default you have 'standard' .xiz loads and saves from/to all sources.

In Yoshimi->Settings...->Main settings there is a new entry 'Saved Instrument
Format'. This can be set for Legacy (.xiz) Yoshimi (.xiy) or both. The new
format has the Yoshi doctype instead of the Zyn one. Zyn will not recognise it
at all.

Exactly what you select will be saved. The Yoshimi format includes all the
controllers, The part Mode status (Poly Mono, Legato) and the Humanise setting.

When loading files Yoshimi will always look for .xiy ones first, and if it
can't find them will then look for .xiz ones. Parts loaded from .xiy files will
have mid-blue text. The colour seems to show up well

This is part of the rationale of the new instrument format. We will *never*
make any changes to the standard ones, and you will always be able to load and
save them. However we will slowly be adding improvements and refinements to the
new format, with (where appropriate) compatible adjustments to the standard
ones.

There is a caveat when handling instruments in banks. If you set for only
Legacy or only Yoshimi but have previously set for both, saving to such a dual
entry will erase the one you haven't selected. I don't know why that happens at
the moment (banks are 'interesting').


LEGATO COLOURS

It is not obvious that legato interacts with the drum mode switch in the kit
editor, and this latter takes priority. Therefore if drum mode is set legato
does nothing but still shows in the mode selector. This has now been
highlighted and it now shows in red text. Cancel drum mode and it becomes
active and the text turns black again.

A further refinement is that if you use the remote legato switch (CC68) and
Yoshimi had been set to poly, or mono, the text will change to legato,
returning as it was when the pedal is released. Again, it will be red if drum
mode is set.


HISTORY LISTS

The last used file in any section is now always at the top of it's history
list, so it's easier to pick up where you left off.

Also, now all of these - instruments, patch sets, vectors, scales, midilearn
and state - offer the most recent entry whenever you want to load or save. On
first time use (when there is no history) you will be offered your home
directory as a location, regardless of where Yoshimi was called from.

In the specific case of instruments, when *saving* you will be offered the one
in the currently selected part in your home directory, otherwise when saving
these 'managed' files you won't be offered the previous last-used unless it was
seen on that session, either by being loaded, or saved by name. This is to
protect against accidental overwrites.

e.g.  You've been working on 'foo' for a whole day saving the whole patch set
as you go, then the following day you start up yoshimi and immediately have
completely new idea 'bar' and start working on it. Without thinking you save
and hit 'Return'. Oops, your just wiped out 'foo'.

Only now you haven't, because while loading would see the older file, saving
just offers your home directory to put a new name in.


DEFAULT STATE

The State menu now has a new option 'Save as default' which will save whatever
you have set up as the default state. This is only effective if you also have
the 'Start With Default State' option checked in settings. This is also
exceptional is it will *not* appear in the history list, so will not be offered
as a normal load.

There is a 'gotcha' with this, in that when you save the default state you must
*already* have set the 'Start With Default State' switch, otherwise reloading
the default state works *once*, but upon re-opening yoshimi, the switch will be
unchecked - i.e. quite correctly in it's previous saved state!


VU IMPROVEMENT

Previously it was possible for the metering to miss a very sharp attack. That's
been sorted, and yet the overall behaviour is smoother.


PADSYNTH PROTECTION

Previously, if you were in the middle of setting up a huge pad instrument it
was still possible to try to edit kit items while this was in progress... and
Boom!

This is now blocked, and any attempt to modify the PadSynth engine during an
'apply' will return the message "Part [n] is busy". Working on other parts, or
the rest of the synth is not affected.


EFFECTS INTERPOLATION

This means that if you MIDI-learn the controls, you can now automate them
smoothly instead of the somewhat gritty previous behaviour. There seems to be
no detectable change in processor demand when running as low as 64 frames per
period.

This upgrade is especially effective on 'saw' sounds with the frequency control
on the EQ low pass filter.


BANK IMPORT - EXPORT

The Banks window has had some button re-shuffling, and you can import and
export banks as well.

There are a number of benefits to using these rather than messing about with
the directories externally. You have far greater control where things go when
importing, and it's much easier to identify the bank you want to export.

When importing or exporting, Yoshimi refuses to overwrite exisiting banks or
directories. That's a flat refusal for exporting, but for importing it will add
a numeric suffix to the name - I was quite pleased with the way that worked
out.

Importing will *only* copy in files that Yoshimi understands, but will notify
you if there were other unrecognised types in there. Exporting just dumps out
the entire bank contents.

There are a number of banks in the wild that contain all sorts of extraneous
stuff. This usually seems to be copyright notices, but I don't know why people
don't use the instrument text fields provided for exactly that purpose. Oh, and
one bank I found even had subdirectories with pictures - and they weren't small
ones!

Also, if you look in the main part edit window you will see there is a new
button top right. I'm hoping this will encourage people to fill in the
copyright info.

To set it up, fill in the field as normal, then while holding down the Ctrl
key, click on the button (left or middle mouse) . This will now be stored in
your Yoshimi config directory, and whenever you create a new instrument just
click on this and the text will be filled in for you.


SHORTCUTS

In the main window, if you hold down the 'A' key then left click the edit
button you go directly to the AddSynth editor - if it is enabled. However, if
you use the right mouse button you will enable it and then open it.

The same is true with 'S' for SubSynth and 'P' for PadSynth.

On the other hand holding down the 'K' key then clicking will open the kit
editor, and the 'E' key opens the part's effects window.

This probably needs a bit of refinement. It occasionally misses and opens the
main edit window instead. I suspect there is some event stealing going on when
that happens.
