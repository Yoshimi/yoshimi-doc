This "contrib" directory contains my notes, some examples, and material
collected from other sources, some no longer available.

Some of the material here is discussed in the Yoshimi document itself.

The file 9_MIDI_code.pdf is a nice succinct summary of MIDI messages I
found at http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bello/FMT_files/9_MIDI_code.pdf.
The class notes at higher levels of that URL are very interesting.
