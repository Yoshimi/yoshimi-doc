To change the \textsl{yoshimi} MIDI bank or program from within a sequencer:

A MIDI bank change is usually a CC#0 value of 0, followed by a CC#32 value of
X, where X is the desired bank number from 0 to whatever,
(However, in some cases may simply be a CC#0 on its own with a value of X).
Many synths also require that you send a program change after the bank change,
to select the program within the bank.  So, using directions that seem specific
to Renoise....

- Add a MIDI Control device to a track.
- Link the MIDI Control device to the instance of the ZynAddSubFx/Yoshimi
   instrument.
- Expand the number of effect columns in the track to at least 5.
- Map the 1st MIDI Control device parameter to CC#0.
- Map the 2nd MIDI Control device parameter to CC#32.
- Map the 3rd MIDI Control device parameter to Prg-Change.

Now program the following commands into your pattern: (Assuming the MIDI
Control device is #1 in the chain):

   1001 1100 1201 1302 1000

- 1001 = turn the MIDI Control Device on
- 1100 = set CC#0 to 0
- 1201 = set CC#32 to 1 (0 = 1st bank, 1 = 2nd bank, 2 = 3rd bank, etc)
- 1302 = set the program to 2 (0 = 1st program, 1 = 2nd program, 2 = 3rd
program, etc)
- 1000 = turn the MIDI Control Device off

In this particular case, it's important to the turn the MIDI Control device off
again when you don't need it, otherwise it will not correctly transmit the
bank/program changes the next time you need it.
