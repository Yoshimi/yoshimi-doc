Tochange the \textsl{yoshimi} MIDI bank or program from within a sequencer:

AMIDI bank change is usually a CC#0 value of 0, followed by a CC#32 value of
X,where X is the desired bank number from 0 to whatever,
(However,in some cases may simply be a CC#0 on its own with a value of X).
Manysynths also require that you send a program change after the bank change,
toselect the program within the bank.  So, using directions that seem specific
toRenoise....

-Add a MIDI Control device to a track.
-Link the MIDI Control device to the instance of the ZynAddSubFx/Yoshimi
instrument.
-Expand the number of effect columns in the track to at least 5.
-Map the 1st MIDI Control device parameter to CC#0.
-Map the 2nd MIDI Control device parameter to CC#32.
-Map the 3rd MIDI Control device parameter to Prg-Change.

Nowprogram the following commands into your pattern: (Assuming the MIDI
Controldevice is #1 in the chain):

1001 1100 1201 1302 1000

-1001 = turn the MIDI Control Device on
-1100 = set CC#0 to 0
-1201 = set CC#32 to 1 (0 = 1st bank, 1 = 2nd bank, 2 = 3rd bank, etc)
-1302 = set the program to 2 (0 = 1st program, 1 = 2nd program, 2 = 3rd
program,etc)
-1000 = turn the MIDI Control Device off

Inthis particular case, it's important to the turn the MIDI Control device off
againwhen you don't need it, otherwise it will not correctly transmit the
bank/programchanges the next time you need it.

Anote on banks. You *really* need to move some of those out to a new root!
That'sa pretty crowded list. The limit is 128 and you seem to be half way       
there:)                                                                          

Thenumbers are generated the first time yoshimi sees a new root path or new      
bankswithin a root path.                                                         

Onceset, these numbers will never change unless you actually move them
aroundusing the 'swap' button.                                                          
Thenumber is also the MIDI ID so you can be sure it will always be there
forbank changes no matter how many more banks you add later.

Yoshimialways lists these in ID order not alphabetical order, so you can
groupthem sensibly and permanently. However, at first time creation it
setsthe IDs in alphabetical order and tries to space them evenly
overthe range to give   you 'wiggle' room.                                                                
Usingright mouse click often produces modified or alternate results,
especiallyin roots/banks/instruments. In Yoshi this is defined as
buttonnumber 2. Some distros/window managers have number 2 as
themiddle button.

Subject:[yoshimi-user] my answer to a recent enquiry. Thought it should be
here

Presetsare loaded and saved via the copy/paste buffer (the blue C and P
icons).To be really useful you need to create a new directly path.
Probablythe best location is in /home/{yourusername}/.config/yoshimi

Afterthis, if you develop (say) a phaser sound you especially like, you can
copyit to the clipboard, and from there save it to a preset. You can then
pullit back whenever you want to.

Havingsaid that, I hardly ever use it myself so had to try to remember how
itworked.

Wesave more of the data than Zyn does. Particularly, if you've loaded a
instrumentinto a part but then disabled it, when doing a parameter save we
willstill include it along with the rest. Also we save all possible 64
partsif they contain an instrument, even if they are not currently used.
Anypart with the default 'Simple Sound' will have nothing but the ID tag so
won'ttake up much space.

Thisdiscussion was had a long time ago, and it was generally agreed that
theincreased size of an entire parameter set was relatively unimportant
comparedwith losing a sound that you might have temporarily disabled.

Subject:[yoshimi-user] Need a Youtube vid done                                   

I'vetried making a recording of yoshi in action but so far totally failed
toget anything like decent vid along with stereo sound.                       

WhatI especially wanted to do was make one of the demo I did on LAC.          

Forthis you need a 'bare' yoshimi with: bank root enabled as 0 (MSB),
bankchange as LSB, program change enabled, enable part on program
change.

Theonly other thing you need set up is the root path to the banks we supply
setto 9. On a self build this should be /usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks
Distroswill usually store it in  /usr/share/yoshimi/banks                        

Theattached MIDI file will then do all the magic stuff itself, and it looks
*really*impressive if you have the mixer panel open while it plays. I know
thisworks in Muse, I'm pretty sure it does in Ardour, not sure about
Qtractor.

Ifanyone wants the original Rosegarden file this was taken from, let me
know.Unfortunately Rosegarden can't correctly import MIDI files it has just
created:(
