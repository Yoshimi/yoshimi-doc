To change the \textsl{yoshimi} MIDI bank or program from within a sequencer:

A MIDI bank change is usually a CC#0 value of 0, followed by a CC#32 value of
X,where X is the desired bank number from 0 to whatever,
(However,in some cases may simply be a CC#0 on its own with a value of X).
Many synths also require that you send a program change after the bank change,
to select the program within the bank.  So, using directions that seem specific
to Renoise....

-Add a MIDI Control device to a track.
-Link the MIDI Control device to the instance of the ZynAddSubFx/Yoshimi
instrument.
-Expand the number of effect columns in the track to at least 5.
-Map the 1st MIDI Control device parameter to CC#0.
-Map the 2nd MIDI Control device parameter to CC#32.
-Map the 3rd MIDI Control device parameter to Prg-Change.

Now program the following commands into your pattern: (Assuming the MIDI
Control device is #1 in the chain):

1001 1100 1201 1302 1000

-1001 = turn the MIDI Control Device on
-1100 = set CC#0 to 0
-1201 = set CC#32 to 1 (0 = 1st bank, 1 = 2nd bank, 2 = 3rd bank, etc)
-1302 = set the program to 2 (0 = 1st program, 1 = 2nd program, 2 = 3rd
program,etc)
-1000 = turn the MIDI Control Device off

In this particular case, it's important to the turn the MIDI Control device off
againwhen you don't need it, otherwise it will not correctly transmit the
bank/programchanges the next time you need it.

A note on banks. You *really* need to move some of those out to a new root!
That'sa pretty crowded list. The limit is 128 and you seem to be half way       
there:)                                                                          

The numbers are generated the first time yoshimi sees a new root path or new      
banks within a root path.                                                         

Once set, these numbers will never change unless you actually move them
around using the 'swap' button.                                                          
The number is also the MIDI ID so you can be sure it will always be there
for bank changes no matter how many more banks you add later.

Yoshimi always lists these in ID order not alphabetical order, so you can
group them sensibly and permanently. However, at first time creation it
sets the IDs in alphabetical order and tries to space them evenly
over the range to give   you 'wiggle' room.                                                                
Using right mouse click often produces modified or alternate results,
especially in roots/banks/instruments. In Yoshi this is defined as
button number 2. Some distros/window managers have number 2 as
the middle button.

Subject:[yoshimi-user] my answer to a recent enquiry. Thought it should be
here

Presets are loaded and saved via the copy/paste buffer (the blue C and P
icons). To be really useful you need to create a new directly path.
Probably the best location is in /home/{yourusername}/.config/yoshimi

After this, if you develop (say) a phaser sound you especially like, you can
copyit to the clipboard, and from there save it to a preset. You can then
pullit back whenever you want to.

Having said that, I hardly ever use it myself so had to try to remember how
it worked.

We save more of the data than Zyn does. Particularly, if you've loaded a
instrument into a part but then disabled it, when doing a parameter save we
will still include it along with the rest. Also we save all possible 64
parts if they contain an instrument, even if they are not currently used.
Any part with the default 'Simple Sound' will have nothing but the ID tag so
won't take up much space.

This discussion was had a long time ago, and it was generally agreed that
the increased size of an entire parameter set was relatively unimportant
compared with losing a sound that you might have temporarily disabled.

Subject:[yoshimi-user] Need a Youtube vid done                                   

I'vetried making a recording of yoshi in action but so far totally failed
toget anything like decent vid along with stereo sound.                       

WhatI especially wanted to do was make one of the demo I did on LAC.          

Forthis you need a 'bare' yoshimi with: bank root enabled as 0 (MSB),
bankchange as LSB, program change enabled, enable part on program
change.

Theonly other thing you need set up is the root path to the banks we supply
setto 9. On a self build this should be /usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks
Distroswill usually store it in  /usr/share/yoshimi/banks                        

Theattached MIDI file will then do all the magic stuff itself, and it looks
*really*impressive if you have the mixer panel open while it plays. I know
thisworks in Muse, I'm pretty sure it does in Ardour, not sure about
Qtractor.

Ifanyone wants the original Rosegarden file this was taken from, let me
know.Unfortunately Rosegarden can't correctly import MIDI files it has just
created:(
