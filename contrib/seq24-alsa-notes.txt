Provided here is a basic sanity check for hooking up Sequencer24
and Yoshimi.

1. Set [manual-alsa-ports] to 0 in ~/.config/sequencer/sequencer24rc

2. $ yoshimi -a -A &

3. $ sequencer24 &

   File / Options / MIDI Clock / [5] 129:0 (input) = Off

   ("[5]" is the MIDI port for Yoshimi, and might have a different
   number on your system.)

   File / Open / open a MIDI file

   Right-click on an existing sequence:

      Select [5] as the MIDI Output Bus (5 is system-setup-specific).
      Select 1 as the MIDI Channel on that Bus.
      Arm the sequence (to dump to MIDI buss); it will have a black
         background in the Patterns Panel.

Yoshimi:

   Make sure part has an instrument loaded and is set to the same MIDI
   channel.

Start playing the sequence in Sequencer24 and verify that Yoshimi
reproduces the pattern audibly.
