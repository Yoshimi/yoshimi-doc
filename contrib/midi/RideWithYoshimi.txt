At the end of my LAC workshop I demonstrated a song being played using 16 parts
with multiple bank changes and program loads while playing, starting with a
'bare' Yoshimi. Although I used Rosegarden for this, I also have a MIDI file
that runs here with:

aplaymidi -p yoshimi /data/Source/RideWithYoshimi.mid

If you are interested I can send that file to you. Its only requirements are
that root ID 9 points to the default bank set supplied with Yoshimi, and default
MIDI settings are in place.

The CLI 'read' command now has an alias 'get'. Personally, I don't like pairs
of commands that are phonetically very similar (set/get) but this was requested
and was very easy to implement. Which reminds me, I don't know if I ever
mentions that there is another alias pair 'program' and 'instrument' are
interchangable wherever either is used. This was added to deal with the
conflict that MIDI talks about program changes, but Yoshimi thinks of
instrument changes.

As well as doing program changes while running, this also overwrites some parts
several times. Total playing time is just under 8 minutes. You should
definitely have the Mixer panel showing, and if you have the 'Reports' window
open you'll see the bank and program changes listed. Also if you have the
instrument list window open you'll see it swap sets.

We could certainly do with more tunes in the Yoshimi SC group ;)
