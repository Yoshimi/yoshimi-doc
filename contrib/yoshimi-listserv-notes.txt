I'm pleased so say *all* file loads incorporating scales are now correctly
tuned, and done properly not with the fudge I implemented earlier.

This bug goes right back to Zyn 2.2.1 and was caused by the very last line of
the scale (usually 2/1) not being converted to an actual scale entry.

So, load and save scales is also fully available to the CLI.

Incidentally, the 'Retune' button in the Scales window is needed if you change
any of the actual scale settings. However, it's not needed for key mappings or
any other controls, all of which operate immediately.

Vector load and save is now possible from the CLI. That's a complete vector
set, with all mappings, instruments etc. You can independently decide which
channel to load and save from, so you can actually build up a vector set in
(say) channel 3, then later decide you want to use it in channel 7.
It has the extension .xvy standing for Xml, Vector, Yoshimi

It seems to be reliable, but there is a bit more tidying up I'll be doing. 
Also, I want to integrate it with saved states.

Another small detail is that all the minimum CLI abbreviations are now
Capitalised in the help list.

Some more CLI goodness.

The way you enter vector features is now much more user friendly.

The individual features are now numbered 1-4 and can be Enabled or Reversed (any
other word disables). Reversed means that instead of the X left rising in value
with increasing CC value it decreases. X right does the opposite of course.

1 is always fixed as 7 (volume) and is not reversible.
2-4 can also have the outgoing CC changed to any valid one.

This is just about the only CLI entry that starts from 1. This is because
internally 0 means no features, and trying to fiddle the numbers makes the code
a lot more confusing.

The original system where bits were ORred together was done to make NRPN
control as efficient as possible. That hasn't changed, but log messages refer
to the CLI numbering.

Oh dear, I really shouldn't do this sort of stuff when suffering heavily from a
bad cold :(

I can't believe how many mistake I made.

Here is the correct version... I hope!

An example to set up vectors from the command line:
Assuming we want just a single axis on channel 1 (2 in the GUI)

First we need to make sure we have enough parts available:

yoshimi> set available 32
Available parts set to 32

Then:

yoshimi > set vector 1 x cc 14
Vector channel set to 1

This command must aways be the first as everthing else hangs on it. It's the
command that enables vector control. cc is the incoming sweep CC that will vary
the features you set.

There are 4 features available
1 is fixed as volume
2 is pan by default
3 is brightness by default
4 is modulation by default

We'll select volume for this example so:

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 X > set features 1 enable.
Set X features 1 en


Now you need the set the instruments that will be used. These can only be the
ones in the current bank, so, assuming we are in Will Godfrey Companion

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 X > set program left 20
Loaded 20 "Bubbles" to Part 1

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 X > set program right 120
Loaded 120 "Ghost Ensemble" to Part 16

If you now sweep the the controller assigned to 14 the sound will morph between
these two instruments.

To go on to using the other axis as well you need to have 64 parts set so:

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 X > /set available 64
Available parts set to 64

Then:

yoshimi > set vector y cc 15
Vector 1 Y CC set to 15

Well use panning for this vector so:

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 Y > set features 2 enable
Set Y features 2 en

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 Y > set program down 107
Loaded 107 "Angel Harp" to Part 32

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 Y > set program up 78
Loaded 78 "Brassy Flutter" to Part 48

Notice that the directions left,right,up,down match a traditional joystick.

Now you can save your ultimate vector sound:

yoshimi Vect Ch 1 Y > save vector CoolSound
Saved channel 1 Vector to CoolSound

At any time you can reload this.
yoshimi> load vector channel 0 CoolSound
Loaded Vector CoolSound to channel 0

If you don't give a channel then it will be loaded to the same channel as it
was saved from:

yoshimi> load vector CoolSound
Loaded Vector CoolSound to source channel

The file extension we use is .xvy but this will be added automatically.

I was playing about yesterday evening with Rosegarden (and Yoshimi of course)
but was getting frustrated with wrong volume and pan settings.

Eventually it occurred to me to enable our (fairly) new CC monitor. This pretty
quickly revealed the problem. Rosegarden was sending CC121 - reset all
controllers - at the start of some segments!

This prompted me to add an ignore button in the midi config window. It's off
by default, but mine is now on, and will probably remain so!

It seems some people don't like our startup splash - Boo!

So if you really can't wait another second for Yoshimi, you can now disable it
in the main config window.

NP. You've done a good job of putting it into more digestible form :)

<aside>
Whenever I get a cold I always end with 2-3 days extreme cough. I sometimes

</aside>

Right {rolls up virtual sleeves}

To answer your second question first:

In Yoshimi, all CLI file operations are standard file specs.

"/home/user/directory/file" will go to that specific location.

"file" will look only in the current directory, whatever that happens to be.

Now for the more complicated bit :)

I first thought about vector control long before we had 64 part capability,
iand ntended to use just sequential parts/channels. I was put off by several
things.

First: How do you stop one vector definition overlapping another? Do you
restrict it to blocks of 4? If so, what about the 'wastage' with a mixture of
single and dual vectors?

Second: My compositions frequently use 12 out of the 16 available channels. That
leaves room for only one vectored one.

Third: how do you stop an otherwise valid MIDI CC breaking a vectored setup?

Stepping forward, 64 parts was initially just an experiment to see if it could
be done. Once proved viable, my first thought was vectors!

By going down 'columns', instead of across 'rows' you don't reduce the number
of available channels for normal MIDI operations.

By default an entire column uses the same MIDI channel, so, remembering that      almost all numbers in the CLI start from zero, you have:

CH 0 - parts 0, 16, 32, 48
HH 3 - parts 3, 19, 35, 51

Although seemingly offset by 1, these match up nicely with the part groups in
the mixer panel.

As setting the programs is not done by numbers, but by X/Y L/R I thought it
best to report back the actual parts that were being set. This also meant I
could use the existing code without any modification.

With steady refinements over time, it probably wouldn't be too difficult to give
the user the choice of a vertical' or 'horizontal' basis, but I'm not keen on
the idea myself - we're still falling behind on more important stuff :(

Usual caveats apply: If someone wants to offer a patch I'll look at it :)

Incidentally, with Yoshimi idling on this office computer. 16 parts gives 0.8%
dsp load and 64 parts pushes that up to a whopping 1.1% :)

Ah yes. I know exactly how you feel. I revised the ALSA code in yoshimi. It's
much better than it was, but I'm still not totally confident it's right :(

Oh, another note (or two). The MIDI tab has changed. All the items squished up a

Hi Chris,

Just to let you know that most of the command line entries can now be read as
well as set. Eventually they all will be, but currently significant missing ones
are vectors, effects & volume/pan/keyshift.

In the CLI help menu that only needs a change in one line - 'Set' becomes
'Set/Read' :)

It's now a general principle that groups of stuff will be 'List' but individual
items will be 'Read'.

At the same time as doing this, I've moved a bit more direct access out of the
gui. It's still not thread safe, but at least it's all slowly moving to a
central 'clearing house' in SynthEngine.

There are times I wish I could take a sabbatical from Yoshimi, but it seems I
have a tiger by the tail :(

State saves should be straightforward. It's all XML with the individual
subsections clearly identified.

At the end of my LAC workshop I demonstrated a song being played using 16 parts
with multiple bank changes and program loads while playing, starting with a
'bare' Yoshimi. Although I used Rosegarden for this, I also have a MIDI file
that runs here with:

aplaymidi -p yoshimi /data/Source/RideWithYoshimi.mid

If you are interested I can send that file to you. Its only requirements are
that root ID 9 points to the default bank set supplied with Yoshimi, and default
MIDI settings are in place.

The CLI 'read' command now has an alias 'get'. Personally, I don't like pairs
of commands that are phonetically very similar (set/get) but this was requested
and was very easy to implement. Which reminds me, I don't know if I ever
mentions that there is another alias pair 'program' and 'instrument' are
interchangable wherever either is used. This was added to deal with the
conflict that MIDI talks about program changes, but Yoshimi thinks of
instrument changes.

As well as doing program changes while running, this also overwrites some parts
several times. Total playing time is just under 8 minutes. You should
definitely have the Mixer panel showing, and if you have the 'Reports' window
open you'll see the bank and program changes listed. Also if you have the
instrument list window open you'll see it swap sets.

We could certainly do with more tunes in the Yoshimi SC group ;)

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.13.2 (GTK+ 2.24.30; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

In the current master, just about the whole of the history system has been
refactored. It now uses a single file for all instances recording any
non-duplicated loads or saves. At the same time I uncovered and squashed a minor
bug in the display of a loaded state. The code is now slightly smaller, and I
think clearer.

For those interested, previously we were (per instance) using 3 deque's for
the three history types. These held both the full file paths and separately
the leafnames. When the 'recent' browser was opened, the leafnames were then
copied to the fltk browser list.

Now we use 3 simpler static vectors to hold just the full pathnames. When the
browser is opened these are read, and just the leafnames extracted for the
browser list.

Also, previously the code and data straddled SynthEngine and Config. It's now
entirely in SynthEngine. I hope that was the right thing to do.

I've tested it on two quite different computers so it should be fine.

P.S.
This it the first time I've coded vectors :)

A bit more now :D

ALL CLI stuff

You can now read the status of a single vector, and both this and the bulk list
have more detail.

When stepping through system and insertion effects the GUI is now properly
updated, although I still haven't got part effects in sync yet.

Listing histories can be individual ones or all three, and I've rationalised
the internal numbering to allow for possible future extensions.

Still a long way to go though!

Well now. It seems I've wrapped myself up in a pretty package :o

In the MIDI spec there is *no* pitch shift controller. Also, the notes I made
for myself 2 years ago I never actually implemented, so currently Yoshimi can
*only* be pitch/key shifted either via the GUI or CLI.

This is not to be confused with fine detune, which is a MIDI RPN (unsupported).

So, what I propose to do is implement master, channel and part pitch shift via
NRPNs.

Looking at hardware synths (I have 3 different ones here), it seems that locally
they all restrict pitch shift to +- 2 octaves, so maybe I should expand
Yoshimi's range consistently to, say, 3 octaves.

Internal oscillators I'll leave alone (muttering under my breath that I still
think it's an insane range).

How does that sound?

These can be set in the GUI the CLI and via MIDI NRPNs. With NRPNs part shift
can be set by direct part control or by channel number.

Subject: [yoshimi] Smooth Instrument Transitions.
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.13.2 (GTK+ 2.24.30; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

This is something I demonstrated on my miniLAC workshop, but in order to make
it obvious exactly what was happening I spread the controls across the 'normal'
16 parts/channels.

It is actually much more useful if you use 32 or 64 parts and work 'vertically'
by channel numbers. In the next commit, the following notes will be added to
'doc/Using_More_Parts.txt', so if it's not clear please let me know so I can
update this.

------------------

Another possibility is getting really smooth transitions between different
sounds on the same channel.

If you use program change to do this, that part has to be muted, and there is a
variable time lag (while the new part is loaded) before you can play any more
notes on that channel. However, with 32 and 64 parts you can actually overlap
notes with different instruments on a playing channel.

This is done by pre-loading the wanted instruments, then switching channel
numbers. If (via the direct part NRPN) you add 16 to a sounding part's channel
number it will then only respond to note-off events. To bring it back into
operation simply restore the original channel number.

An example:

Enable 32 parts

Load 'Simple Chimes' into part 0 (part 1 in the GUI).
Load 'Silver Bell' into part 16 (part 17 in the GUI).
In your sequencer, via direct part NRPN set part 16 to channel 16.
    This will now be 'whited out' in the GUI

Record some notes to channel 0 - usually represented in sequencers as channel 1
- yes I know this gets confusing :(

In your sequencer just before the first note that you want to sound as 'Silver
Bell' insert two direct part NRPNs. One to set part 0 to channel 16, and the
other to set part 16 to channel 0.

Now when you play this through, the last 'Simple Chimes' note will have it's
full release and reverb tail, blending into the first 'Silver Bell' note.

When you want to go back to using 'Simple Chimes' just reverse the NRPNs.

The only time this gets complicated is if the new note is exactly the same
pitch as the old one, in which case the NRPNs need to be between the old
note-off and the new note-on.

Subject: Yoshimi effects trial
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.13.2 (GTK+ 2.24.30; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

If you have some spare? time, there's something I'd like your opinion on.

Yoshimi has an experimental branch called 'effects'. It's only 'user'
difference from the current master is that it has a hidden command 'test'
accessible only from the CLI.

While working on the CLI I pretty quickly realised I was duplicating a lot of
what was in the GUI. Much of this shouldn't be in either (especially limit
values) but should be in the effects code itself.

So, what I have done here is to copy all the effects text and ranges into each
of the associated effects, with some overall control in the effects manager.
The CLI code (Misc/CmdInterface) accesses this via Misc/SynthEngine - I've
tended to use this as a central access point for lots of things. I've tried to
arrange this so that in the future, additional effects can be added with minimal
disturbance to anything outside the effects code itself.

I'm not at all sure if I've done this in the safest and/or most efficient
manner (hence this request), but if it looks OK, my idea is to then strip out
all the direct settings in the GUI and use this new indirect access. If that
works out OK, it will be *much* easier to implement all of this in the CLI too.

In the CLI code where the 'test' entry is there is a block of comments that I
hope will make things clear.

It's here too if you want a quick overview:

        /*
         * Test routine for direct access to all effect names & limits
         * -1 can be used as out of band parameter
         *
         * EQ (7) is very strange and still not quite right :(
         *
         * if t4 is 0 return string
         * t1 effect number. 0 or out of band returns "No Effect'
         *
         * t2 preset or controller number to read
         * out of band returns effect name
         * t3 list type
         *   0 - effect/preset name
         *   1 - not used
         *   2 - long controller name
         *   3 - short controller name
         * out of band retunes 'Invalid"
         *
         * if t4 is 1 return value
         * t1 effect number. 0 or out of band returns number of effects
         *
         * t2 preset or controller number to read
         * out of band returns number of presets or number of controls
         *
        *
         * t3 data type
         *   0 - min value (number of presets of t2 out of band)
         *   1 - max value (number of controls of t2 out of band)
         */

Hope you can look at this.

In the current master, if you right click on a button that opens a child window
the current window is closed. Conversely, if you right click on the 'Close'

This is especially useful when going up and down the AddSynth stack, and avoids

auto-connect the main L&R outputs. For a while, I've been deliberating on the
idea of providing this as a preference in yoshimi->settings->jack, and probably
having it default to 'on'. I'm not inclined to have it trying to start jackd.
That can do strange things in some environments.

Indeed so, and about a month ago I checked them to ensure they work. I didn't
test the jack session ones (never use session management myself) and on my
machine using the -k argument to start jackd ends up running jackdbus which
just seems to route all jack audio to /dev/null :(

As of now, the jack autoconnect status can be set in both the GUI and CLI
It defaults to 'on'.

However this does highlight an anomaly. Unlike most CLI startup 'switches' you
can't turn it off here (you can once in a running CLI). With the others, the
lower case letter is the off switch as in 'C' & 'c' for CLI and no CLI. However
'k' is already used for starting the jack server.

One idea would be to have a new switch pair, maybe 'M' & 'm' for 'main jack
autoconnect' and 'no main jack autoconnect', but still keeping the 'K' for
backward compatibility.

How does that look?
