Subject: Yoshimi updates.
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

I've created more work for you :)

In the master version there are significant extensions to the NRPNs that Yoshimi
handles. Some of these may seem pointless... unless you are unable to use a GUI
for some reason. It's likely I'll make another release (1.3.6) very soon.

There's information in the doc folder, but do shout if you have any questions.

Also we now have a email list separate from sourceforge, but have managed to
port across all the old yoshimi-user archives.

You can subscribe with an e-mail to: yoshimi-request@freelists.org
or by visiting: http://www.freelists.org/list/yoshimi

Subject: Yoshimi notes
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Hi Chris,

I've just had another look through the epic! work you're doing on the manual.
Here are some clarifications (not in any special order).

x There has been a lot of re-organisation of Yoshimi->settings. The CC tab is now
named MIDI.

x Curiously named period size, is now where it should be in main settings and
called internal buffer (which is what it really is).

x Oscillator size is now called AddSynth Oscillator size, to make it clear what
it really is.

NOTE The command line help menu has also been updated.

x Using XML compression can save file access time which may be beneficial if
your machine is borderline on latency.


In the Alsa menu

x The purpose of Alsa Midi Device is the same as the command line
--alsa-midi="{name}" and is so that Yoshi can auto connect to a MIDI source
such as a keyboard. The one I have here identifies itself as Hua Xing.

x Similarly Alsa Audio lets you connect to a sound card by name. In my case,
with a Komplete Audio KA 6 the command is hw:K6. This is particularly
useful for USB modules, as you can never be sure where they will appear
numerically.

x From V 1.3.6 onwards (and current master) what using alsa audio Yoshi first
tries to connect 2 channels at 32 bit depth, but negotiates with whatever
the soundcard will support. In my case that. 24bit 6 channel (but Yoshi
only' uses 1&2)

x At one time you could in theory have 1000 roots, 1000 banks and 1000 presets.
This is ludicrous! Roots and banks were trimmed to what can be addressed
from MIDI, but you can still have 1000 presets, not that I've ever tried to
prove it!To paraphrase, 2,621,440 instruments is enough for anyone!
(128x128x160).

x Refreshes have been removed because they are no longer needed. The code self
syncs better.

x You can't reach root paths through the Yoshimi->settings window any more - it
was causing a nightmare of syncing with the other entry routes. You can
reach it from the Instrument tab, or the Banks window or the Instruments
window, both of the latter also have multiple entry routes!

y It's probably best to more clearly separate the concept of parts V channels
these days. There are only 16 MIDI channels, there are up to 64 parts each of
which can be on any channel or disabled :)

x Part audio destination (jack) is saved with the parameter sets, so is the number
of available parts. Zyn will still load these but ignores any settings it
doesn't recognise. If you re-save in Zyn, the settings will be lost.

x Zyn, and older versions of Yoshi it's possibly to end up with un-named
instruments. Since V 1.3.4 Yoshi will trap such an occurrence and name it 'No
Title'. Yoshi won't let you save the unedited default sound!

x In parameter sets Yoshi will save named but disabled patches. Zyn doesn't. Be
aware of that!

x It is advisable to copy all the default Banks to userspace so you can them
re-arrange edit and add to them easily. Just keep the default for emergency
recovery.

x Un-numbered instruments in a bank will be given a 'temporary ID starting from
number 160 and working down. If those numbers already exist then they will be
skipped over. This can get very confusing! However, if you simply load it
and re-save it to the same slot it will gain that ID and be properly fixed.
You can the move-swap it with others.

x All Root, bank instrument IDs are used by MIDI controls, and as of V 1.3.6 will
also be accessible to the command line.

x We no longer say anything about Yoshi being better at alsa/jack
implementation.It's no longer true. Performance-wise the two are
neck-an-neck these days, although there is one special case where yoshi
dramatically out performs Zyn.I've only recently discovered this and
don't want to say anything more until I've discussed it with Mark.


x Subsynth sliders.
The top row sets the *relative* amplitude. This is an important distinction as
the overall level is normalised, so all actual levels will be dependent on
whichever is the highest.

x The bottom row sets the bandwidth of each harmonic. If you have just the
fundamental and drop the bandwith to minimum you get very nearly a sinewave.
Set it to maximum and it is very obviously filtered noise!

x The part effects layout was changed at the request of people at LAC2015. it now
more closely matches the appearance of system and insertion effects.

n As of V 1.3.6 the splash screen stays up a bit longer, and gives more
information if it has a problem.

New instance with alsa audio - yes we know! haven't worked out a sensible fix
yet :(

x state V parameters
State saves *everything* parameters saves everything that is relevant to that
collection of sounds... That's the theory. I must recheck this sometime :)

x Saving settings or not.
If you change settings and close without saving that means they remain in
place only for the current session. If you've changed anything, when you close
Yoshi you will be given a second chance to save them. If you say 'no' the next
time you start, the old settings will be restored. I did think of creating an
'undo' feature but it gets pretty crazy very quickly.

x The new coloured engine backgrounds aren't just pretty. They give real
information about expected processor load, and time to be ready when loaded.
Processor low to high, Pad, Sub, Add.
Time low to high, Sub, Add, Pad.

x Default master volume is 90, part is 96 add (overall) sub, pad is 90, addvoice
is 100, effects are all over the place - don't ask me why!

Phew!

Hi Chris,

The latest 'master' version on github carries the version number 1.3.6 rc2.
However, there is new branch called 'command' which has all the latest
command-line additions and this will *probably* be merged into 1.3.6 unless
something really bad is lurking in there. I've reverted to C style string
handling for this. I find it much easier to get *exactly* what I want :(

New files in doc:
x Command_line.txt
x Dynamic_System_Settings.txt
x Yoshimi_1/3/6-features.txt

Significantly updated files:

Direct_Part_Control
NewFeatures.txt
Vector_Control.txt

Minor updates:
Using_NRPNs.txt

For what it's worth I've been using this synth since Zyn 2.2.1 and am *still*
finding out new things about it!

I've had a quick look at the cookbook and you're doing very well there. But
don't forget that Yoshi really picks up her skirts and runs when creating
sounds that have no real-world analog at all!

Good news on Sequencer24. I'll try to find time to give it a run.

You have my sympathy :)

However once you get to grips with the UI it's actually pretty consistent.

That's not a bug. It's intended. It's part of the anti-clutter feature of those
windows. In the same way, if you right click on banks or roots it closes one
window as it opens the other.

Open the panel window and it's just above the Edit button of each part. You
have Main, Part or both.

P.S.
Right click on the edit button and you actually open the instrument edit
window, otherwise it just selects it as the current part.

Also any click in the part label opens the current instrument window.

To a degree we try not to change things in an unexpected way. Old Yoshi, and
Zyn don't give you the option at all. We also try to keep a pleasing visual
balance so couldn't increase the width by much. Also, we already use a very
small font for that button. To get two words in you'd need a magnifier :(

Ummmm :)

We did think about making a right click open the name editor instead (like it
does in the top level) but I think that got a bit complicated and it was
abandoned.

Just remembered something.
When using rotary controls. Left mouse button move gives coarse control, right
button gives fine control. The scroll wheel gives better control than moving
the mouse, and if you hold down the ctrl key at the same time the control is
*extremely* fine.

For vertical sliders only, if you hold down the right mouse button then move it
slightly the peg will go to it's default position. the same will happen if you
click on the track with the right button - bet you never knew that :)

Hi Chris,

A little clarification,

In the settings window, 'Save Settings' refers to the entire window, not just
individual tabs. The close buttons are actually outside the frame of the tabs.

Also 'Close without saving' doesn't mean revert to previous settings, it means
use the changes but don't immediately store them to the filesystem.

Oh, and there are a few more bits in the 'command' branch :)

A frame is a single sample of however many channels you are handling, so if you
are using jack, a mono signal will have frames of 1 float, 2 for stereo etc.

ALSA is more complex as it handles pretty much the sound card's format,
commonly ints, 24 bit ints (low byte ignored), and short ints. Less commonly
it may be floats or the weird 24 L ints. I'm still not sure if these are packed
or low aligned (top byte ignored). I've assumed they are low aligned, but I
don't know anyone who has such a card in order to prove it. As a matter of
interest the only ALSA format yoshi doesn't support is float - again, no way
to test it.

The new command line entry system has proved stable enough to move to 'master'.

Meanwhile we are working in a different implementation in 'command' that
eventually should be much better and more easily extended. At the moment there

OK, unless anyone comes up with a serious objection or alternative, for V1.3.6
in the gui, and in all notes 'Parameter' will become 'Patch Set' (exactly the
same number of characters), so obviously 'Parameters' changes to 'Patch Sets'.

There will be no changes in the code, nor in any XML files.

This is only a small detail, but these things add up. If you see any other
wording that's obscure, I'm quite happy to look at it.

Something that's not obvious is the way that ALSA audio is controlled and who
takes command.

If you set a specific destination then Yoshimi says what it wants. It's often a
negotiation on bit depth and channel count, but Yoshimi nearly always gets
to decide the buffer size (it will be set to internal buffer size). However if
the destination is 'default' then ALSA decides on the sound card, bit depth,
number of channels and the buffer size - Yoshimi will set it's internal
buffer size to match. On my machines this always seems to be 1024.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Over the last few days I've been doing some extensive testing of the current
master, including LV2 - something I don't normally use. My test file was one
that performed full bank and program setup from a midi source file as well as
volume and pan settings. However, I made an unfortunate discovery.

If Yoshimi's internal buffer is *smaller* than the jack buffer it sounds quite
horrible. If it's the same or greater there's no problem. The reason I didn't
find this before is that it only affects Yoshimi LV2. Also it doesn't apply to
any of the released versions.

The cause of the problem is that the LV2 code doesn't have the same looping
structure that was added to the standalone routine to deal with exactly this
situation (re-entering the audio 'construction' function until the jack buffer
is filled). I'm hoping Andrew can deal with this fairly soon as I don't
understand the LV2 code very well.

There are valid reasons for wanting different sizes for these buffers. The
internal buffer size as well as affecting latency and CPU load also alters the
sound in quite subtle ways. It particularly affects the behaviour of filters.
One day we may be able to stop this happening, but in the mean time we have to
live with it. For my purposes I find a buffer size of 128 or 256 is best.

So there we are. We have a problem. You can get round it, but I'm reluctant to
make the next release until it's fixed :(


Moving on from that, I was testing using the latest versions of Ardour, Muse
and Qtractor as LV2 hosts. I also tried Carla but couldn't get anywhere with it
at all - if someone is familiar with it I'd be interested in what results
they get.


Slightly to my surprise the one that performed the best in every respect was
Qtractor. Muse got everything correct, but was prone to Xruns on program
changes. Ardour was very problematical. There were no Xruns but it seemed to
have odd timing issues. Also, on two occasions it managed to shorten the decay
times of two of the instruments. I don't understand how it managed that.

My reference was the original midi file played into a stand-alone Yoshimi via
aplaymidi. This also behaves identically to the file being sequenced by
Rosegarden.

We have one known outstanding issue, but it's not a show-stopper and there is a

Please have a look at the current master version (rc5). There is a combination
of internal buffer size and jack buffer size that can give LFO and envelope
timing errors but only (it seems) for the latest version of one LV2 host.

To all practical purposes the current master *is* V 1.3.6 (even identifies as
such). This evening I'll put the tarball on sourceforge, and write up the notes.

For a sneak preview, in 'doc' look at 'Command_Line.txt' and
'Yoshimi_1.3.6-features.txt'.

The information on ALSA has been updated in 'ALSA_Setup.txt' and
'Dynamic_System_Settings.txt' gives some information on the extended NRPNs.

P.S.
Yoshimi is a continuous learning process. I'm *still* finding out things I
didn't know about it!

P.P.S
Changelog gives you a blow-by-blow account of the nitty-gritty.

Subject: [yoshimi] Yoshimi V1.3.6 - At last!
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

All known issues have been fixed, but I'm not going to be so stupid as to say
there are no others :)

Anyway, please do download and have a play with this - especially the new
command line options. It needs a good shake-down to find out what works best.

The obligatory blurb...

One of the main features of this release is improved accessibility. The
effectiveness (and indeed usefulness) of this will help shape future
complimentary interfaces. Also, a number of first-time defaults have been
changed to make this easier.

It has always been possible to run Yoshimi headless, but now real control is
available. In the first place, when starting from the command line, an argument
can be included for a new root path to be defined to point to a set of banks
fetched from elsewhere. This will be given the next free ID.

Once running, almost all dynamic setup (i.e. doesn't require a restart) can now
be done within the terminal window. There is also extensive control of roots,
banks, parts and instruments including the ability to list and set all of
these. You can now do things like:

Path add /home/music/yoshimi/banks
Set part 4 program 130

Additional controls that are frequently taken forgranted in the GUI but
otherwise get forgotten are master key shift and master volume.

Finally, we have the most important parts of vector control exposed to the
command line.

For all of this there is extensive error checking and feedback.

In parallel with this there are more NRPNs so that you can perform some of
these via automation. That arrangment looks positively steam-punk, but is
actually very easy to use, requiring only a utility that can send MIDI CCs.
NRPNs aren't special. They are simply a specific pattern of CCs. Yoshimi's
implementation is very forgiving, doesn't mind if you stop halfway through
(will just get on with other things while it waits) and will report exactly
what it is doing.

Another significant improvement is to the handling of ALSA audio, which is
still very important for some people. Up till now we've been insisting on 2
channel 16 bit format. Tests have shown that virtually all motherboard sound
chipsets will handle this, but many external ones don't. So now we initially
request 32 bit 2 channel and work towards a compromise :) With external sound
modules in mind, endian swaps are also implemented.
Vector control has been extended so that there are four independent 'features'
that each axis can control, One is fixed as volume (if enabled) but the others
can be any valid CC and can also be reversed. The vector 'sweep' CCs are split
out very early in the MIDI chain and the new CCs created are fed back in before
any other processing. The result of this is that once we eventually get
MIDI-learn implimented the control posibilities will expand dramatically -
sorry about the extreme delay :(

When using the GUI, there are additional style improvements and tweaks. Also,
Yoshimi is a bit more informative when there are insurmountable problems,
especially at start-up.

In the 'examples' directory there is now a complete song set, 'OutThere.mid'
and 'OutThere.xmz'. Together these produce a fairly complex 12 part tune that
makes Yoshimi work quite hard.

Finally, as well as document updates and the usual crop of bug-blatting, a
couple of obscure regressions have been fixed.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Having had some time to actually look at these (after the bugfix) I realise
the entire concept is in fact very powerful.

Absolutely everything that has blue C P buttons can be stored in the presets
directory. That includes entire Addsynth engines! Also, when you look at the
copy/paste buffer, you only see items that are relevant to the group that the C
P buttons are in.

As you want to be able to save as well as load these presets, it makes sense to
copy all the default ones to a location such as .config/yoshimi/presets. That
makes them fully accessible, but tucked away out of sight. Possibly I could set
up yoshimi to create this directory at first time start up.

The directory structure is the same as the *old* bank roots so I'm thinking of
changing that. There is the same problem that if you have several preset
directories with the same named preset you'll see all of them together, with no
idea where they came from. If I change that so you only see and manage items in
a *current* directory I think that will be more manageable.

Hahahahaha {wheeze}

Murphy was listening :(

All I can say is there can't be many users wanting to save and load presets!

Using them immediately was fine but attempting to save them missed off the
name, leaving just the type and suffix, so you'd keep overwriting the same one.
This goes back a very long way.

More recently, a 'clean' start would fail to locate some default banks and
presets locations.

Both of these are corrected in 'master' but in view of the low profile (and the
fact I've only just made a release) I won't bother to make a bugfix release
unless someone gets *really* unhappy.

There is one detail to sort out eventually. When you paste an effect it doesn't
update the effect name in the selection tab. A workround is the step the effect
number up then down.

If you can fake a command line environment, then almost all the 'running'
commands are available, but none of the instrument editing ones are... yet!

So you can decide what midi/audio setup you want, list and set roots and banks,
load instruments into any part, change a part's channel, set main volume and key
shift, and set up vector control.

This is from V 1.3.6, and the current master has more development. I don't
think we'll be changing any of the existing commands (although this is still
very much in development) but more will definitely be added.

All previous MIDI messages are of course recognised.

Please let us know how you get on. The more info get back on how this is
performing the better we can fine-tune it.

Subject: [yoshimi] yet another question
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

While trying to develop the command line interface we have the situation of
commands with multiple arguments. Currently the longest is a vector command:

set vector [n1] x <n2> control <n3>

n3 is the CC to be used for feature number n2 on X vector channel n1. The 'x'
is a sort of hidden parameter as the code uses an offset dependent on whether
it is x or y. Also n1 can be omitted in which case it will use the last defined
channel number. Using alternate words and numbers gives a great deal of
flexibility like this.


However, I've had one person say it should be in this style:

set vector x command <n1> <n2> <n3>

Note that n1 now has to be compulsory. The argument in favour of this is that
you can then create shortcuts in the form:

svxc <n1> <n2> <n3>

However, we already allow users to type no more than four characters, so with
the assumed n1 the shortest form is:

set vect x n2 cont n3

and we could probably fiddle some form of shorcut in the form:

svx <n2> c <n3>


Whatever way we go there is in fact quite a lot of work to this (most of it
error checking) so before going much further I'd like some opinions.

Subject: [yoshimi] Instrument reset when deactivating LV2 plugin
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.24 (2015-08-30)

When working with the LV2 plugin in Ardour my instruments were frequently reset to
a boring sine wave.
After some debugging I found out that Ardour likes to call deactivate() when
stopping playback, which in Yoshimi also resets all instruments
(YoshimiLV2Plugin::Close: synth->defaults()).

I'm wondering if it is correct to reset the synths when deactivating a plugin,
regardless of whether it is appropriate to deactivate() all plugins when stopping
playback - I really don't know a thing about LV2.

Hi Alexander,

I think that it's not right to reset synth to defaults in that case.
From lv2 api documentation:

Deactivation is not similar to pausing since the plugin instance will be
reinitialised byactivate()
<http://lv2plug.in/doc/html/group__lv2core.html#ad34d59efaed8faaf8a05a4c375f62415>
.
However,deactivate()
<http://lv2plug.in/doc/html/group__lv2core.html#a1a1019ea8a92e3e1239c2ddde58360d0>
itself
MUST NOT fully reset plugin state. For example, the host may deactivate a
plugin, then store its state (using some extension to do so).

So, It's my mistake. I'll fix it today in git master branch. This is not a
problem, of course :)

The problem is fixed (I hope :) ). Now on deactivate plugin will only call
'Mute()', but not 'defaults()'.
Changes are in git master now, but, if you are building yoshimi from source,
open 'YofhimiLV2Plugin.h' and replace line 87 with

void Close(void) {synth->Mute();}

and then recompile.

I had also read the LV2 spec. and it says that you should only deactivate at
the end of the *last* run, so I would have said it was an Ardour problem.
However, I guess it is slightly ambiguous as to what is meant be 'last'.

In view of the fact there are various times when *some* sequencers decide to
send resets, I'm wondering if we should make things like this switchable - like
we do for bank changes etc.

Incidentally, this reminded me I'd stumbled on a work round a long time ago (and
forgot about it) by loading up instruments at the start of a session then
immediately saving the project.

Any unrecognised command will trigger this, including just hitting return. It
is very much a moving target. The current master is quite a bit more developed
and does list '?' and 'exit' as proper closures. It is also being used as a
test bed, so although it should remain stable, expect name and organisation
changes.

It also behaves slightly differently if there is a rouge '&' on the end. In
taken away the environment it was spawned from.

Eventually, the structure will be quite different (although that won't be
visible to users). Tokenisation in an interesting idea for language support,
but so far none of Yoshimi has this so it as a bit moot.

Currently these settings are not stored anywhere. What do people think of the
idea of including them in patch sets?

The downside is that there would be no immediate way to differentiate these
from normal patch sets and if you wanted just the set and not the vector
control we'd have to think up a way of cancelling it. Setting number of parts
back to 16 would be one way although it would leave the sweep CCs active...
sort of!

Another possibility would be to create a new vectors file, although that would
create some duplication as it would need to set the number of parts as well as
ensuring the wanted instruments are loaded.

Hi Chris,

Just thought I'd let you know that command line access is now coming on very
well. The code is somewhat cleaner, and unix style paging and history is
implemented. The latest addition is the ability to list the parts that
currently have instruments loaded. It was almost worryingly easy and the
command is just:

"List current"

The first line you see is the number of available parts (16, 32, 64), then each
following line is in the form:

Part number, Audio destination, Instrument name.

For audio destination you have:

'M' = Main L&R
'P' = Part L&R
'B' = Both
'-' = part is disabled or higher than the number available.

This way you can tell if your most valuable instrument patch is installed even
if it is not currently usable.

To avoid unnecessary list length, the default "Simple Sound" is not shown
unless it is enabled.


Incidentally, I've fiddled with command names and order a bit so that all of
them can be abbreviated to the first three letters.

The 'docs' folder has been updated too.

Subject: [yoshimi] Scale/keymap settings lost in state file
User-Agent: Roundcube Webmail/1.1.1



Hi,

First a big thank you for working on Yoshimi! And also to everybody
writing on this mailing list. I've been following it for roughly two
years, and I really like the "ambiance" in which the software is
developped.

I seldom wrote here myself. I only restarted using yoshimi in the last
couple of weeks. It's very smooth, lots of improvements (I appreciate
amongst other things all the work on bank/program change)… But I'm
afraid I have to report what is likely a bug. A small one though for
sure.

In the scale settings, you can set various intervals ("Tunings") to a
range of keys ("Keyboard mapping"). IMHO the whole logic of these scale
settings is a bit arcane. But
http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc_2.html#w2 [1] explains it pretty
well.

So I have this Hijaz mode, with 10 notes/octave, and I want to play it
on my keyboard (which has 12 notes/oct). In the Tunings section I have:

14/13
9/8
32/27
49/39
4/3
3/2
21/13
16/9
49/26
2/1

And in the keyboard mapping section, I set:

0
1
2
3
4
5
x
6
7
x
8
9

The two x are to skip the corresponding keys. They don't play at all,
which allows the octaves to wrap logically on the keyboard (as if there
were just 10 keys per octave). I also set "Middle note" to 64, to start           the scale on E keys. Therefore its big/small intervals alternate
coherently with my tone/semitone fingering habits.

The problem is that the two x are replaced by two 0 in the state file.
So when I reopen yoshimi and reload the state file, I get

0
1
2
3
4
5
0
6
7
0
8
9

And this of course does not work. Every 0 key in an octave has the same
tuning. And the octave interval is no longer obtained on keys e' with
e'' but on e' with f#''.In the state file, the x-s are correctly stored
in a specific way : their value is -1<KEYMAP id="9">
<par name="degree" value="-1" />
</KEYMAP>

So it seems that the problem is how yoshimi handles these -1 degrees
when it reads the state file. It replaces them with 0 when they should
be x.
I'm afraid this was a bit of a lengthy explanation for a simple problem.
I'm not sure how many other people use (or at least understand) the
scale settings, that's why I thought I'd give in some detail…

On a side note, the ability to play non-tempered scales is what drove me
in the first place to Zyn and later to Yoshimi. It's quite unique in the
free software world. At some point, the way these settings work could be
made more intuitive maybe.

Thanks for your attention!

Cheers,

Victor

Thanks Will! This indeed solves the x-s being replaced by 0-s.
Now when I reopen Yoshimi I can _see_ the keyboard mapping I had when saving
the session file. However, it doesn’t _sound_ right yet: I need to press the
Retune button for that.

You can test this with the settings I mentioned: an octave on the keyboard
should sound like an octave in sound (but upon restart it doesn’t, until you
press Retune).

> That was quite an interesting bug, and it goes back a very long way.

Indeed, through your posts I can see that moving Yoshimi forward is also an
exciting archeological endeavour. That must be nice! By the way, when
compiling today I glimpsed this line passing by
Reverb.cpp:403:2: warning: #warning sa schimb size-ul
That’s mixed Romanian-English for "I have to change the size". An ancient
flint from a distant era, I suppose.

Well that was very interesting. Archaeological indeed! Going back to Zyn 2.4.0
there never was the ability to save microtonal settings :o
and you could only load tunings and mappings separately. You can still do that
if you have the individual files but it was Cal who introduced the combined
load/save capability in 0.058. Complete state saving arrived in 0.060

Auto retune is now in 'master' for both scale or state loading. Tunings and
mappings I've left as they were.

Comparatively recently 'Patch Sets->Clear' was expanded to include scales. It
also more fully resets 'Controllers'. In fact I don't think there is anything
it *doesn't* reset now. I'm wondering if this is now in the wrong place,
although I can't think of a better one.

Hmmm. How about the word Reset, on the top line with a yes/no warning that it
will clear ALL dynamic parameters.

Ha! Just found something it doesn't reset... the last peak VU values :)


Finally, that 'sa schimb' line was one that Cal put in replacing Paul's
original (English) hidden comment. There are examples of Cal's impish humour
dotted all through the code :D

Yes the 'Clear' command has been there a long time, but I was just thinking it

Following on from the Scale/Keymap thread, I've given this a bit more thought
and would like to consider the following changes:

In the Instrument tab, change the order to:
Show Instruments
Open Instrument
Save Instrument
Show Banks
Show Root Paths

Also remove 'Virtual Keyboard' - It has its own far more obvious button.

In Patch sets remove 'Clear'

In the bar below, move the three existing buttons and add a new 'Reset' one laid
out:

Stop    Panel
Reset   virKbd

This layout would also enable the buttons to be wider so maybe less compressed
wording! Also I think the new reset button should be red like the stop one is.

Should we go further and have a new top line tab called e.g. 'Show'
with Instruments, Banks & Roots there instead of in the 'Instrument' tab?

Any thoughts/alternatives?

I think this would be easier and more obvious to new users but would it be
too disruptive to existing ones?

Chris, indeed, Yoshimi is a marvelous community :-)

It is also true that until recently I found the Non suite ranging from
difficult to impossible to build, depending on the year; I used to try it
once every six to twelve months or so because the feature set is so
extraordinary.  But recently I do believe Mr. Liles has been getting things
amazingly right.  For quite a number of years a crucial element of my
B.N.R. (the Box of No Return, discussed here <http://lsn.ponderworthy.com>)
has been less than completely stable, the mixing capability; I have tried
every one out there many times, and jack_mixer was the closest, but
jack_mixer still often became confused, perhaps because the B.N.R. keeps a
LOT of active connections at all times.  Then I tried non-mixer yet one
more time, and voila!

And just this week I rebuilt the B.N.R. again, for the first time using
Sparky Linux (very Debianistical) as a base, and the Non suite built
shockingly fast and easily.  It's just a bit confusing because one has to
build NTK first, but it's all documented on Mr. Liles' web site.

I have not tried the Non Session Manager for quite a while, because I ended
up building my own very tight automatic system in Python scripts.  (The Box
always runs headless in production.)  But if NSM is working well for many,
perhaps it might be a good thing to encourage :-)

The larger the oscillator size the greater the CPU load but the better the
quality (supposedly). Zyn changed the default to 512 a long time ago, and
I'm think we should do the same. I can't detect any difference, and only an
infinitesimal one when going down to 256. Why waste CPU cycles.

Existing users won't see any change as it will stay at whatever your config file

My latest idea on this is to keep it quite separate and as a user savable file
exactly like individual instruments or patch sets but with .xvz as the
extension.

The file would include whether it was a 2 or 4 'row' controller the sweep CCs,
the features that had been set and whether any had been over-ridden from the
default ones. Finally it would include the actual instruments that had been
originally used.

I think it should then be able to be loaded into whatever is the the currently
selected channel.

Pros
Very easy to set up.
Doesn't care about later bank/instrument layout changes

Cons
Will fail if you have already set the CCs for some other purpose.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

We may have a solution to this oddity (installing to obscure locations). What
would be very helpful would be for people *not* using vanilla debian to try it
out.

If you look at src/CMakeLists at or near line 527 you should see:

set(LV2_INSTALL_DIR ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/lv2 CACHE PATH "Specifies where the
LV2 libraries should be installed")

What I'd like you to do is comment it out so you can restore it if you need
to (put a # in front of it) then enter this one below it:

set(LV2_INSTALL_DIR lib/lv2 CACHE PATH "Specifies where the
LV2 libraries should be installed")

Remember to clear out the cmake cache before trying (unlike me) with:

make distclean

then do the usual ccmake .
make
{root}
make install

You should get yoshimi.lv2 in /usr/local/lib/lv2/
If it was already there before, you should move it.

Please let us know what results you get and which distro.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Doing a bit more investigation on this, I can see these are more interesting
than I realised.

The first thing to keep in mind is that the three 'base' engines are in fact
kit item 0 - regardless of whether kit mode is enabled or not. Even though they
are represented differently at their top level, internally they are identical
to all the other 15.

Also, the part as a whole has min and max notes, but if kit mode is enabled each
kit item has it's own min and max *within* the overall part range.

Another subtle change is that in kit mode you no longer apply all three part
effects to any of the kit items, but only one, selectable from the kit window.
This includes the three 'base' engines.

If you want more effects on a part kit you need to use the insertion effects.

Hi there,

I am a Yoshimi user (great soft by the way!) trying to get Yoshimi to work inside 
Ardour as a plugin.
I use the Ubuntu Studio distribution and I have no trouble working with Yoshimi
alone but I can not seem to find it in the list of plugins for Ardour. It does not
appear in my /usr/lib/lv2/ either.

Based on some research and this
(https://www.freelists.org/post/yoshimi/LV2-install-revisited), I had the idea of 
downloading the sources and build it but it didn't work (I have to say that this
is far beyond my skills and I am very confused with the cmake instructions).

Can somebody here give me some advice?
Thanks,

'View' is now the second item on the menu and includes the Scale settings

All the others have the menu items re-ordered to

Scales now has a clear option, and I'll see about a 'recent' item for State

In the process of this I've discovered defaults surrounding state load & save

I'll try to get this sorted soon.

Reset all controllers missed out a couple, and didn't update the window. Both

If running with ALSA audio, you can no longer attempt to start other instances.
This wasn't a valid option anyway, as it is jack audio specific, and the
attempt would cause yoshi to quit.

Adding or removing root paths via the command line now updates the gui (if it's
running).

And finally, you can enter commands as single letters (separated by spaces) if
they are completely unambiguous.

So:

s p p 107 - sets part {default/last used} program to 107

sa s - saves the dynamic settings

l b - lists the banks in the current root

I'll probably remove he feature in 'settings' that lets you face MIDI CCs. It
was only experimental. There are already better ways of getting control, and
these will be added to.

Subject: [yoshimi] Yoshimi & Rosegarden - fun times.
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Yoshimi can have up to 64 parts. By default these are wraped around the normal
MIDI channels, so 1, 17, 33 & 49 all respond to channel 1 messages. This was
originally implemented for Vector Control, working with up to four sounds on a
channel (similar to the Yamaha SY hardware series).

However, these have other less obvious uses. One of these is getting far more
than 16 completely independent tracks addressed by just the 16 channels. Most
tunes run with instruments having a relatively narrow pitch range, and this is
what we can make use of.

As an example, in Yoshimi's main window select 64 parts, then on part 1 set
(say) Steel Bass and maximum note as 52 (E).

Next select part 17 and enable it (easiest to use the mixer panel for this) set
Tunnel Piano, the *minimum* note as 53 and maximum as 71 (B).

Finally, enable part 33, set Rushes and set it's minimum note as 72, but key
shift down an octave.

With a 61 note keyboard that gives you quite a useful working range, on just
one channel.

However, the idea really comes into its own with a sequencer like Rosegarden
where you can record multiple parts over the full MIDI range and track them to
the same channel. Also, in Rosegarden the parts can be separately named, and
identified as Bass and Treble in the notation editor. This makes it very
convenient for those wanting a more formal musical layout.

So, with very little effort you can now have 48 tracks playing at once!

Ummm, you do need a decent processor though :)

Yes, I know you could run more instances of Yoshimi on different MIDI ports, but
where's the fun in that?


> With a 61 note keyboard that gives you quite a useful working range, on
> just one channel.

Thanks for pointing this! I wasn’t aware of the warping feature. This setup
sounds very interesting for the kind of music I try to play these days
(Middle-Eastern dabkkeh, in Omar Souleyman’s style). It involves frequent
changes of instruments, each instrument playing on a very narrow range… Right
on, I’ll try it asap!

We are definitely in the time for 'small things' at the moment.

A few irritations scratched in the current 'master'

Directly setting part channel numbers from 0 to 15 as 16 to 31 respectively,
will now allow a note off while blocking all other MIDI messages to that part.
setting them higher than 31 will stop all messages so you can use this for
creating set & forget drones.

Preset directory additions or removals no longer need a restart.

Part key shift extended to +- 24 semitones - 4 octaves should be enough for
anybody :)

Default state file location is now fixed - users could always change it as they
wished with the file browser. Also, the setting was saved but never read!

Subject: [yoshimi] Mea Culpa :(
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

I'm afraid I have to put my hand up to having created a rather obscure bug.
This was back about half way between the 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 releases, but it
wasn't until much later someone reported the first symptom.

He found that if he had a lot of continuous pan or volume changes sent over
MIDI, the gui seemed to be locked out for that time. I had a quick look but
couldn't see anything wrong with the code, so put it aside - just looking again
from time to time.

Much more recently, I discovered that if you had any part windows open and sent
the above commands, they would be mysteriously closed. Again a quick look
revealed nothing.

The final straw was when running a recent version of Rosegarden, Yoshi would
crash every time just one specific file was loaded. This was unusual in that
at the time of loading *all* 16 parts would have a program change at the same
time!

It didn't take long to work out that it wasn't actually loading programs that
was causing the crash but the gui updates. At this point I remembered someone
telling me about using git bisect to pin down exactly when a bug occurs. I
can't praise this enough. What might have been many hours of work shrank to
about 15 minutes. Just one commit was responsible for all three problems.

I had been struggling with the problems of gui updates for program changes, the
new colour backgrounds and change of number of available parts. I eventually
hit on the idea of re-creating the part, which magically seemed to solve all
the problems. I should have recognised that there is no such thing as magic!

So what did this *actually* do? It closed down and deleted the entire part then
rebuilt it with newly fetched data from the synth engine.  It was this rebuild
that was responsible for the disappearing part windows - obvious really. Also,
that is a lot of processing to do in a hurry, so much so that the fast MIDI pan
changes could barely keep up. Once the nest of program changes was also put in
the mix, well it couldn't keep up at all.

So, having pulled the errant code out, I set about getting the gui to respond
correctly. Hopefully it is OK now in the current master. Certainly, none of the
original problems show here after running for several hours with lots of patch
loading, reloading and general messing with the windows - as well as running
*that* file in Rosegarden.

I shall now go and stand in the corner facing the wall :(

A couple of additions in the current master.

If you are in kit mode, the engine window title bars now display the kit number
and name (if any). This way you know *exactly* what kit item of what part you 
are working on. I will eventually extend this to the Resonance window and the
AddSynth Voice windows.

In Yoshimi->Settings->MIDI there is a new checkbox that will allow you to see
all MIDI CCs as they arrive (before Yoshimi does any filtering). This is not
stored and is always 'off' at startup - so you don't forget about it. The only
time you're likely to need it is if you have a hardware controller of some sort
connected that doesn't seem to be working.

One slight oddity is that 'pitch bend' shows here as CC 1000. Although it is a
quite different control mechanism, it is routed through the CC code for
convenience.


Another small detail the Presets window doesn't chop off the first letter of the
preset name any more :)

Aha! The thot plickens :)

He had actually applied his patch on top of yours, because he was working
against V1.3.5.2 - although that two releases ago. However that means both
combined works for him, and they work for me on Intel & AMD 64 bit machines, and
an elderly 32 bit AMD.

If that combination also works for you I think it means we've covered most of
the bases.


Although not yet released I've just put a bugfix version 1.3.7.1 up on both
github and sourceforge that includes these. Can you give it a try and let me
know what you find?

There are also a couple of quite obscure bug fixes in there.

We used to register all parts by default, but that got a bit silly once we had
64 of them, so we changed to an 'on demand' model.

If you open the mixer panel window you'll see a field just above the Edit
button. This determines the audio destination on a part-by-part basis,
defaulting to just the main LR pair. The direct part outputs are only exposed on
parts that are active, and have the destination set to either 'part' or 'both'.

Once activated they will remain in place even if the part is later disabled or
routed to main only. This is so that other programs won't see links suddenly
disappear - although they will become silent.

This setting is preserved in Yoshimi's patch sets and will be reinstated when
next loaded.

I've just realised this doesn't seem to be mention in the notes in the doc
directory - it will be on the next commit!

it just occurred to me that you can actually do this already without the need
for any changes at all :)

Load up Yoshimi, set it for 64 parts, then go through them all, enabling them,
setting the audio destination to 'Both', then *disable* all of them except part
1.

Close down to 16 parts and save this as a patch set named (say) newdefaults.

Yoshimi stores *all* part data in patch sets, even if the part is disabled.

i:Exit  -:PrevPg  <Space>:NextPg v:View Attachm.  d:Del  r:Reply  j:Next ?:He

Close down Yoshimi.

Every time you want this configurations start with the -l argument so:

yoshimi -l {path} newdefaults.xmz


After this, every time you enable a part its direct output pair will be
registered and immediately available. However, I don't recommend leaving unused
parts enabled, as there is a processing overhead even if they are producing no
sound.

Well, I guess it would be possible to set a preference for the default state,

[-- Attachment #1 --]
[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 2.5K --]

And two that really are :(

While trying to track down two extremely rare and obscure bugs I got bogged
down for a while in what seemed to be a string corruption one.

In the arpeggios bank set, numbers 9, 10 & 11 seem to be corrupted if you load 
them via a MIDI program change, whereas going via the instrument bank appears to
be quite correct. Well actually that's not true. It is the bank load that is
wrong and this goes right back to Zyn 2.2.1

Each instrument has a filename, but also has an *internal* name. Normally these
two are the same, and are guaranteed to be so if you save an instrument to a
bank. However, there is nothing to stop anyone saving an instrument file
externally with a different filename or at some later date just changing the
filename. Neither of these will change the internal name.

So what to do?
What I've come up with is for banks to continue to show the filename, but when
loaded the part will show the internal name. This makes all load operations
consistent.

Also, to make save operations consistent as well, if saving externally you'll
first be offered the internal name (although this will be lost if you use fltk's
built in 'Favourites' option to change directories.

This is in the current 'master'.

Well, that's the good news.

There are two very obscure bugs I'm trying to chase down both triggered by one
specific malformed Rosegarden file, which causes it to send a storm of 48 of
each Root, Bank, Program changes mixed up with 192 other CCs!

The first is caused by the program change thread getting its knickers in a
twist. You can stop this by changing line 514 of /src/MusicIO/MusicIO.cpp:

        if (in_place)
to
        if (true)

The downside is that you then go back to program changes being in-line with all
other MIDI and potentially creating a timing bottleneck.

The second problem is even more obscure. You will only see it if Bank Root
change is enabled *and* either the Banks or Instruments window is open. The
dodgy file will then cause Yoshi's gui to freeze and you can only clear it
with a kill -9
Obviously something is not getting updated, but I don't know what.

Both of these only seem to be triggered by this specific file, I've never seen
this behaviour at any other time. Also, there have been a lot of changes in
Rosegarden itself, so older version may not do this.

I've attached the problem file for anyone who wants to have a look at this.

I just realised that the new audio & MIDI 'preference' saving in 'Settings'
also applies to command line options. This gives you a means of recovery if
Yoshimi won't start because (say) you set it for a sound card you no longer
have.

Run from the command line as follows:

If you are running with ALSA type in 'yoshimi -a=default -A=default'

Or with jack running type in 'yoshimi -j=default -J=default'

That will get you up and running and will remember the preferences next time. Or
you can then go into 'Settings' and change them to what you really want.

to the note-on event, so is per note and also per part (but the whole part not
just one engine).

It was intended to simulate to effect of fretless instruments, or fretted ones
that are weight or bend sensitive, where tiny variations in normal playing
would result in such pitch 'inaccuracies'. It also works quite well on flute
and whistle sounds. I've used it a few times myself and values of 2-3 seem best.

I'm wondering what use (if any) others have made of it, or even if anyone has
recognised what it does!

Currently this setting isn't saved. It's still classed as an experimental
feature. Also, if we keep it and want to save it, should it be an individual
instrument parameter or applied for that part in a complete patch set?

Yes. In the code it is applied at the point the incoming MIDI value is
converted to actual pitch.

Difficult. It's placed where it is because it applies to all three engines and
kits. I would have liked it to be a knob or slider, but being experimental I
went for minimalism. Hmmm. Maybe change the label to 'Humanise'?

I'm actually thinking of reducing the range to 5 cents (10 on the scale).

FWIW I try very hard to minimise layout changes whilst at the same time
improving clarity and access. Unexpected changes annoy people, and changes to
that top menu bar caused even me problems at first. I'm so used to the top item
of 'Patch Sets' being 'Recent' that I'm inclined to hit the wrong one :(

I hope we're just about there now. Apart from the above there are only three
other *possible* changes in mind.

The first is in the same window, and would be a duplication of the audio
destination drop-down that's in the mixer panel. I'm again thinking of placing
it in that lower strip but between Rnd. Det. and Close. This makes sense as it
is also something that applies to the entire part.

The second would be in Settings->Jack and would be a drop-down to change the
*default* audio destination.

Finally, also in Jack, for some time I've been thinking of providing the same
Midi Device setting that's in the ALSA tab, but it's a very low priority.
Nobody has actually asked for it.

Debian is still stuck in V 1.2.4 (unless you go for sid). Both myself and the
maintainer are a bit annoyed about that. 1.3.4 (I think) should have gone in
jessie but there was a ridiculously long freeze period for that one.

As mentioned elsewhere there's a bug we've only just clobbered in 'master' but
it is extremely obscure and only gets trigged by a few files in one sequencer.
So far, nobody has actually reported it. I found it myself while trying to make
some gui refresh improvements.

OK, that settles it :)

The latest 'master' has a slider now. Also, previously there was an error in
the math (never my best subject) giving a much higher detune than I thought. It
is now reasonably accurate and covers the range 0 to 50 cents.

I still can't make up my mind whether it should be stored in patch sets or in
the individual instrument file :(

I'm slightly leaning towards it being in patch sets. Partly because it doesn't
mess with existing stored instruments but can work with them, and partly because
it seems to me it's part of an overall performance.

Ho Hum

Subject: [yoshimi] Banks & Roots
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

A bit of clarification on how changes to these operate.

If you change a bank root path, either through the gui or via MIDI, it will
always reset the current bank to the lowest numbered one it can find. This is
because there may not be a bank in the new root with the same ID, and even if
there is, there is no guarantee that it will have the same name or contents.

Also if an attempt is made to reload the same root, nothing will actually
happen. The same is true of banks. Both of these are kept fully up-to-date so
there would be no point.

However, reloading the same *instrument* will be performed every time, as you
may have changed what is currently loaded without saving it. This provides an
effective 'restore' operation.

By default MIDI control of bank root is CC0 and bank is CC32, these are the
standard bank controllers in the MIDI spec. However, not all synth makers
and sequencer programmers adhere to that, so in Yoshimi->Settings->MIDI you can
change them (or even disable them completely). The bank CC can be either 32 or
0, and bank root can be any value not reserved by anything else.

Hi Adam. Sorry to hear you this is *still* giving you headaches :(
I never can follow exactly how multi-arch is supposed to work, and from that
log it seems quite a lot of stuff is being put in the wrong place.

Try using CMakeListsAlt.txt instead, although I think you may need to swap lines
516 and 517. I can't remember which one worked for you previously.

Until (and unless) this can be finally sorted out I'll maintain both copies
from now on.

Hi Will,
just to report my compilation of 1.3.7.1 on my Debian Jessie.
I did the steps I've always followed with all previous versions:
- cd /src/
- (I edit CMakeList.txt to set default alsa MIDI and compilation flags for
core2)
- cmake .
- make
- sudo make install

The "sudo make install" command correctly install the LV2 plugin, but all the
data files are being installed in the root filesystem, ie: the banks files are
installed in /yoshimi/banks/ (I attach the "sudo make install" output).

It seems that there's a problem with the cmake variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR, because if I edit CMakeCache.txt, replacing the
line
CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR:PATH=
with
CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR:PATH=/usr/local

the data files are installed in the correct locations.

    Cheers

Thanks for letting me know. This is the same issue that Adam had. It seems that
the people at exherbo are using an environment variable that is not set by other
distros. It also seems that when I thought I'd completely cleared all Yoshimi
cmake details from my own system in order to test this I'd left some detail
behind. I seem to remember having this problem before and never could work out
exactly where cmake was hiding stuff :(

For the time being, I would suggest everyone move CMakeLists.txt somewhere else
and rename CMakeListsAlt.txt to CMakeLists.txt. You probably then need to
comment out lines 517 instead of 516.

Meanwhile I'll notify the exherbo people and see what they come up with.

I'll probably revert 'master' to this in the next commit as well.

Subject: [yoshimi] Full Circle
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

When Yoshimi was quite young, jack MIDI stability was very poor compared with
alsa. This is because jack is far more fussy about timing issues, and we were
directly sending data from the MIDI thread to the GUI one. Also some CCs could
be problematical - and program changes were liable to cause storms of Xruns
(there was no bank change at that time). Cal got round this by creating a new
jack MIDI thread and ring buffer. However, alsa rather got left behind.

After the recent improvements in response to the crash caused by badly formed
CC storms, I realised we now had completely detached gui updates from both
MIDI threads, and also the (potentially) stalling root, bank & program changes.
I wondered if the original ring buffer was now redundant. It seems it is!

The current 'master' has this removed. I've already tested it going via
a2jmidid and with both Ardour-4.4 and Muse-3. I'll try to see it it will break
on some of the other kit I've got, but it would be very helpful if others also
tried it out - especially on non-debian distros. It only affects jack MIDI so
if you are using alsa you won't see any difference anyway.

Finally, just in case it all collapses, I've set a tag on the previous
commit called simply 'peg' so you can easily get back to where we were.

For anyone that's interested all the code changes are in MusicIO/jackEngine.cpp
There is a lot of commented out code there now, but I won't tidy it up till
we're sure it's good.

This looks also like a *very* cool and useful feature for quick 'layering'.
With layaring I mean assigning more than one voice to the same (musical) part
to e.g. obtain really fat tones (something I'm lately experimenting with) and
having just one track for the part in rosegarden.

On the basis of eating your own dog food, I've been using the latest master of
Yoshimi for my own compositions, and have come to the conclusion that a separate
'view' tab is a mistake -especially in the cases of instruments and scales.
Also, now 'Presets' path changes no longer require a restart I'd like to pull
that out of the 'settings' menu.

So, my revised idea is:

Instruments
Show Stored
Load External
Save External
Clear


Patch Sets
Show Banks {slightly odd - but where else?}
Load
Save
Recent


Paths {new tab}
Show Bank Roots
Show Presets


Scales
Show Settings
Load
Save
Clear


State
Load
Save
Recent {possible}


Of all of these, I think 'Patch Sets' will be the most heavily used, and
without the 'view' tab it will come nicely in the centre of the top menu bar.

Unless there are howls of protest, I'll probably change this over the weekend,
at the same time as extending Yoshimi's window memory.

Yoshimi 1.3.7 is here.

This just a minor release focussing on usability details.

Yoshimi now remembers most window positions on a per instance basis, and will
re-open them at the same locations. Also, if you shut down with these windows
open, they will be opened again on the next run.

The 'engine' windows are a bit different as they may not actually exist so
can't be auto opened. Also, you need to use the 'close' button to fix their
re-open position - they don't seem to like being asked their co-ordinates when
they are being forcibly closed :(

Almost all window titles carry the instance number as well as details such as
part number/name, engine, and whether it is kit mode. For addsynth oscillator,
the voice number is included. Bank and Instrument windows, as before, show the
MIDI ID numbers along with the complete file paths.

The top menu bar has been reorganised for better grouping. Mixing unrelated
operations on a single menu is never a winner.

A complete clear-down now has it's own button, 'Reset'. This is as close as
possible to a restart, but works independently for each instance. Re-aranging
this group of buttons into two rows means they can be longer - "Virtual Keybd"
is a bit more obvious than "vrKbd".

The 'Controllers' window now (at last) correctly updates when you hit its reset
button.

Other window layouts have had a bit of polish.

There is now an option so you can see the version details of all XML files in
the 'Console' window as they are loaded.

Command line access is now more than just a proof of concept. It has a
half-decent parser, paging and history. All these are developing alongside
considerably more controls.


Breaking news!

This release has an experimental Breath Control feature - CC2.

I'm not generally publicising this yet as it needs to be tried out by musicians
with real breath controllers.

It combines volume with brightness, so the louder the sound is, the harsher it
is too.

In the 'Controllers' window you can play with the 'FiltCut' and 'Vol Rng' knobs
to change it's performance to some degree. My rough-and-ready tests suggest
that you'll probably only want to change 'FiltCut' and leave 'Vol Rng' where it
is. Do  keep in mind these controls are per-part so won't affect anything on      other channels.

If anyone has a breath controller, please give it a try and let me know if it
works for you.

Subject: [yoshimi] Command Line - again :)
X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

With things settling down again the current 'master' has some more work on this.

It now has the beginnings of level sensing and reporting.

If you do "set part 5 "(say)

Your prompt will now show "yoshimi part 5>"

and if you enter either ".." or "/" you'll go back to plain "yoshimi>", but will
still be on part 5. There is only one level at the moment, later the two
different forms will be significant.

If you want to go back to the part level without changing the part number you
can do "set part ?". I'll improve this later.

Also once on part level "set 8" will immediately change to part number 8 and
"set prog 107" sets the program for that part. The same is true for all the
other part level controls.

Further to that, while in part level you can still do most of the base level
commands.

Most of the commands can be reduced to single letter abbreviations so getting
round is pretty fast:

"s p 10 p 107"

will set part 10 to program 107 and leave you at the part level, and after
this:

"s c 3" will change its midi receive channel to 3.

I think the next bit I want to tackle is effects. This will show on the prompt
as one of:

effects system
effects insert
effects part n

and you will then be able to change these.

Something that's not obvious is that if you want to get an effect to cover all
parts together, you use *insertion* effects, not system ones, and you set the
'to' to "Master Out". System is probably a misnomer. Group would be better, but
people are so used to this now I don't think it would be a good idea to change
it.

Anyway, command-line progress :)

You can now enable and disable each part and change their volume, pan &
keyshift. Also the major effects controls are there. That is, the effect number,
the type (Reverb, Echo etc.) and for insertion and part, the 'send'.

Part is a bit odd, because it actually sends to one of the four system effects.
A part's own effects will always sound regardless.

Trying to make all this as simple as possible for the user makes it pretty
complicated to program! Some entries can be a mixture of names and numbers.
e.g. insertion send is off, master, 0-{max available parts}. it also has a
dais-chain capability between effects that I haven't done anything with yet.
I've never actually used it.

Also you can already do some quite long daisy-chains:

set part 3 effect 1 type chorus
that now puts you at the part effects level and:
set send 2 64
will then set effect 2 lever half way up.

Oh, and list effects is pretty obvious.

Most control names can be heavily abbreviated - frequently down to one letter.

Many of the controls also update the gui if it's running. Effects don't, as I
haven't worked out a safe way to do that yet :(

The experimental 'breath control' (CC2) feature is now permanent. I've had an
email from a user with an EWI Wind controller who is absolutely delighted with
it.


I've also had a very positive email from a teacher who employs Yoshimi in his
sound synthesis and DAW courses.


I've had reports from both fedora and debian users that cmake now seems to be
playing nice, so fingers crossed on that one.

I had (yet another) enquiry about getting MIDI into Yoshimi which finally
goaded me into looking into this in a bit more detail. Well, it seems Cal is
still helping us. He left 'hooks' in that I've now used in 'Settings' so that
you can change the preferred connections for both MIDI and audio. These need a
restart but will then be remembered.

I discovered this has an interesting knock-on. Provided your main instance has
jack audio, you can have a second instance configured for quite different MIDI
(and audio if you have more than one sound card). This messes with the Yoshimi
menu a bit if your second instance uses alsa audio, but it works :)

What works very nicely is that you can have two (or more) instances on jack
audio, all set for different MIDI devices and a mixture of jack and alsa MIDI.

I guess a fix that's overdue is to still be able to start Yoshimi cleanly if
there is no accessible audio.

Ubuntu's next long-term release doesn't have a code freeze till mid February,
which gives us time to put a real shine on Yoshimi beforehand :)

We don't support aftertouch yet. The problem is, what do you get it to actually

Just to let you know the help menu and lists are updated, and you can now set 
*all* effects, sends and their levels. You can also select their presets :)

There is much more control possible in effects, but I'll leave that for now and
move on to other controls. I'm trying to implement the most used ones first. Not 
only does that make Yoshimi more usable, but gives me the chance to develop a
better understanding of how it all goes together.

I'm trying to make the most used commands have the shortest abbreviations -
especially the top level ones. So currently we have "? (help)", "s (set)", "l
(list)" along with "sa (save)", "lo (load)", "st (stop)", "ex (exit)".

Exit could have been single letter, but I force two so it's less likely someone
will accidentally type it. I'm also toying with the idea of adding "r (read)"
to work in parallel with set for returning a specific value.

One other thing. It occurs to me that it might be an idea to use capitals to
help identify the minimum abbreviations. It won't make any difference to the
parser as all commands are tested case insensitive. However, I don't know if
that would actually be any benefit to blind musicians. I shall ask around.

Onwards and upwards:)

We don't have whole part LFOs, only ones on the individual engines (and not at
all on subSynth). It's a bit strange really, because we *do* have both pitch
bend and volume MIDI controlled on a channel/part basis.

In fact you could probably emulate LFOs with an automation program feeding into
these two controls.

I don't know what would be involved in building this into Yoshimi, (or where
we'd put the control panel), but if someone would like to look at this I'd
certainly be interested.

Will would it be possible to route aftertouch to the vibratto knob of the Adsynth

Well, that was 'interesting' :?

Aftertouch is not a CC but a control type in it's own right. Also there are two 
forms, channel and key. So, in the same way as pitch bend is translated to
CC 1000, key aftertouch is reported as CC 900 and channel aftertouch as CC
901.

Hooks are now in place (in MusicIO.cpp) but I haven't gone any further yet.
This needs quite a bit of thought, and I don't want to get too distracted from
command line stuff.

As usual, if anyone else wants to progress with this please do so :)

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

There is an error on the help menu. I've put 'prefix' when the command is
actually 'preset'. I've no idea why a wrote that :(

Every valid command should give you a reply message. 'null' ones should too
actually, but I've probably missed a few.

I had intended to attach the effect name to the prompt. For effect presets I
intend to add it's number in brackets, as it doesn't change level. Because the
naming of them is so irregular this is one case where I think numbers are
better. Normally I work on the basis that people can remember names more easily
than numbers.

I really need to sit down and write some proper documentations too.

A brief example:

set part eff type rev
set pre 2

This assumes part 0 and effect 0 and sets the type as reverb
The second line selects preset number 2 (in whatever effect type you have) in
this case cathedral reverb.

This will leave you in the parts -> effects level, so '..' to go back to part
and make any further part changes such as volume, pan, key shift, etc.

If you had done:

set part 5 eff 2 type reverb

Then it would have made those selections along the way. Also '/' and '..' can
be prefixed to any other command but only at the beginning of a new line. After
the above little lot you could have done:

..s v 90

(set the volume)
and then:

/s p 2 en

(enable part 2)

Part effects are 'direct' so are immediately effective and there are three of
them.

System effects are applied to the final sound and receive from individual part
'side chains'. There are four of them, so every part has a side chain 'send'
volume for each system effect.
System effects can also be sent to any one of the following ones - 0 can
go to 1 or 2 or 3; and 2 can go to 3 only.

Insert effects are independent and each can be applied to one of any part or the  final sound. There are eight of them.

At part level: "s 4" changes to part four. If you'd been on vector level it
would have changed to vector *channel* 4

Talking of which, a vector example (assumes you are in the default bank root
path):

set b 110   ... sets the bank
s av 64     ... number of parts available
s ve cc 93  ... cc to use for channel 0 X axis
s y         ... switch to Y axis
s cc 94     ... cc to use for Y axis
s x fe 1    ... switches to X axis and set features (just volume)
s y fe 2    ... switches to Y again and set features (pan)
s pr l 107  ... program (instrument) for Y axis 'left/up'
s pr r 109  ... program (instrument) for Y axis 'right/down'
s x pr l 20 ... change to X axis and program for 'left'
s pr r 23   ... program for 'right'
l ve        ... list currently defined vectors

I worked this one out to test a number of internal switches. It found a couple
of bugs - now corrected. It actually sounds rather nice if you use whatever
controllers you have available for X & Y CCs, preferably on a joystick.

Well I'm more-or-less back.

There's a small update in master, but the Changlog has the wrong date - still
not entirely with it :)

We also have the de-pop feature ported from zyn in Add and Pad synths. There is
an extra control in the amplitude parameters block called simply D.Pop. Its
default setting sounds pretty much as it did without it, but you can wind it
down to no start ramp at all or up for a much smoother note start. This isn't
relevant for Subsynth because of the quite different engine.

Currently I'm working on getting the effects gui to stay in sync when changing
via the command line. Most C/L users will never see it it, but it needs to be
correct.

Hi... again :)

From a usability point of view I much prefer the appearance of the first
midi learn attempt - I've placed it in a separate branch: 1.0-midi-learn

However it is well out of date, and also had some bad implementation issues.

As well as clear indication of what has been set, it gives you the opportunity
to change the min/max values, and even make min > max, thus reversing the         ffect of the control.

It also allows you the have one CC attached to several actual controls.

Instead of MusicIO, the pickup point should be in SynthEngine.cpp ->
SynthEngine::SetController(

This is for several reasons. The first is that it then can't interfere with
root/bank/program changes. Also, at this point pitch wheel, Channel and key
pressure have all been converted to accessible CCs.

Finally, it will be able to pick up vector controls and re-route them to other
effects - this will (eventually) massively expand the vector control features!



Copy and paste is far more sophisticated than a lot of people realise, although
I agree that the interface is not very friendly. I don't think people realise
that when pasting, you only get shown the the presets that are relevant to that
part of the synth. I rather think that 'presets' is the wrong word here, as
people are likely to confuse it with the effects presets.

The way it works is to store a 'copy' as an XML stub, which can either be pasted
elsewhere or stored to file with an appropriate header. When you pick one from
file it simply reverses the process.

Hi All,

I am splitting my topic to two, one is MIDI learn, other will be the
Copy/Paste to make discussions more comfortable.

Thanks for your comments, it is good to talk about it. My original plan was to
port this feature from Zyn 2.5.1/2.5.2 but I will review branch 1.0-midi-learn
and add those usability improvements bellow. Good idea. As well as using
SynthEngine.cpp as entry point.
I also plan to maintain some compatibility with Zyn at least to be able to
load MIDI learn configurations saved by Zyn to Yoshimi and back.

I reviewed https://github.com/licnep/yoshimi some time ago and if everyone
agree let us consider it outdated and take 1.0-midi-learn as a starting point.

Regards,

Csaba Erdei

Hi All,

As I see copy to clipboard and paste from clipboard works, however saving and
loading presets do not.

What I did:

1. Edit->ADDsynth Edit->Show Voice Parameters->Current voice 1->C->Copy to
Preset then named my preset int the text entry field as abcd

2. Current voice 2->P but I do not see my preset abcd in the list. However a
file appeared in presets dir called abcd.ADnoteParametersn.xpz

I have a preset called ResetGlobal.ADnoteParameters.xpz for AddSynth Global,
and it appears in the list, but it is not applicable here.

Copy to Clipboard and Paste from Clipboard does not work for modulation
settings. Maybe it should have different C/P buttons?

It seems to me a bug and some usability problem.

Do you use or test regularly this functionality? Did you see bugs like this
somewhere else?

I plan to add system clipboard integration as a ccmake option which is off by
default. It is might my personal working style only that I like to see the
world trough ssh and vi editor but this minor optional code does not make much
confusion.

Regards,

Csaba Erdei

Just rechecked this (I'd done some work to clear bugs a few months ago)
copy/paste to clipboard seems to work OK here. Sub & Pad seem OK sending to
file. Add global also seems fine. It seemed to include the modulation effects.

It's a bit strange about the voice one. The fault is not in the saving, but the
loading which is supposed to recognise that extra 'n' as meaning just a single
voice.

Yes. It's something that I think was discussed some time ago. It would be good

Subject: [yoshimi] LV2 plugins?

Hi, I am unsure of which plugin to use in Qtractor. "yoshimi" and "yoshimi-multi" 
both show up, and they seem to behave the same way. I am worried about using up
excess cpu, because for every new midi track it seems that a new yoshimi instance 
is opened. Does this consume more cpu? Is there a way to connect different midi
tracks to the same instance of Yoshimi( with different channels, the way you would
do it with the standalone version)? Besides using the standalone Jack version,
because I like to be able to save the whole project in Qtractor.

To clarify this shouldn't be a DAW/sequencer specific question, I would like to
know how to do the same thing in Ardour, for instance.

Thank you for your time,

Hi,

-multi version exposes one stereo output for each channel, so in default setup
you will get 2x16 stereo audio outputs.
ordinal version mixes all channels into one stereo output.

I can't remember the details but last time I setup Qtractor from scratch I
discovered that you don't set a yoshimi per track, but one 'overall' instance,
and then set your tracks to the various part numbers. In pretty much the same
way as standalone.

X-Mailer: Claws Mail 3.11.1 (GTK+ 2.24.25; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

... can give you indigestion :(

Deciding I needed a break from software, I picked up one of my older
compositions to play around with.

This uses 32 different instruments, so at the time I composed it required two
separate instances of Yoshimi (V1.2.0 I think) although no more than 12 are
ever sounding at the same time. It's also nearly 8 minutes long!

With all the improvements we've made I thought I'd merge all the tracks (in
Rosegarden) switching programs in-line. There were more than I first expected,
as some tracks had to switch instruments, then switch back later on. There were
also quite a few bank changes. However, I now have a file that uses a single
'bare' yoshimi. This is similar to the demo track I did before, but much more
complex as well as much longer.

However, there is a problem - Xruns :(
This is running at 48k with buffer sizes at 128. Strangely my office machine is
slightly *better* than my DAW machine. That really surprised me!

This only occurs on program changes - not bank changes, and not all of them, and
not always the same ones. The current release is slightly better than V1.3.5.
V1.3.2 can't handle it at all and crashes :(


A first run seems to work OK, but it when you go back and re-run the problems
occur. This makes me wonder if it's a memory allocation issue. On first run no
parts have anything more than the basic 'Simple Sound'. Also, if I run other
programs between runs of this file, I seem to get more Xruns - some quite bad.

If I switch jack's buffer to 256, things are much better, and with Yoshimi at
256 as well the problem disappears completely, and I can even run this mail
reader at the same time.

Ho Hum. I really wanted a break from software :(

Now that version numbers in these are viewable I guess it was inevitable that
someone would ask the significance!

These numbers are those of the synth that was used to create it. This gives an
indication of what features are likely to be used and you may lose these if you
load a file with *later* version numbers than the program you are actually
running.

For a long time Yoshimi had reported zyn version 1.1 on all these files even
though 2.4 would have been more correct.

We started to include Yoshi versions with 1.3.4 but unfortunately although
the Zyn version was updated in one of the side branches, this never got merged
with master :(

The upshot is that any file with a Yoshi version can be regarded as including
features similar to Zyn 2.4.3.

The current master, and the next release will be tagged with Zyn 2.5 (the Yoshi
version is automatically updated) and has all the features up to Zyn 2.5.2.

This latest update includes just one potential issue when playing old files.
Up to now, the adsynth->voice->filter Q had no effect if the filter type
was 'formant' and the default position for the control was set to 60.
This is now activated and has a dramatic effect. To get the same sound you need
to set it to about 36.

So far I've only come across one instrument file that is affected - one of mine
'Bubbles'.


Right, back to trying to discover why I can't get the command line to update the
part effects gui - system and insertion are fine :(

Hi Andrew,

Recently I implemented MIDI and Audio saved preferences in the Settings
window, and also making such settings from the command line as saved ones. This
makes the compile-time options redundant and I would like to soon remove them.
In fact, I used hooks that Cal had already put in place.

However, if you start with the wrong settings for any reason, Yoshimi still
bails out (although you can now always correct that from the command line).

In Config.cpp Cal provided no-midi and no-audio as well as the ones I used, but
trying to force-set these results in a bailout again. I feel sure Cal
originally intended to make use of them to provide a safe fallback position,
otherwise why have them?

Is this something you'd be interested in looking at?

I envisage a failed start still with Yoshimi up and running. If (say) MIDI was
OK, you'd see Yoshimi responding but just with no audio out. Whereas if audio
was OK you've be able to use the built-in virtual keyboard to produce sound.

You could then access the settings to correct the problem without having to go
via the command line.

In a perfect world it would be possible to change these and have the changes
activated immediately without needing a restart - I've no idea how practical
that would be.

A further practical option would be for both Jack and ALSA tabs to be disabled
when running as LV2.

Hi Will,

There was no feedback from me for a long time, though I still stay tuned with
latest changes in yoshimi :).

I try to summarize the list of changes:

1. If both midi and audio are connected at start with saved settings,
everything is ok.
2. If midi fails to connect (it only can be for saved jack binding, I think),
there can be 2 variants:

a) If yoshimi was started with no gui, then try silently to connect to another
backend and warn about it. If this also fails, simply print another warning
and continue with no midi input.
b) If yoshimi was started in normal mode, then show question dialog if user
wants to connect to another midi engine. Regardless of answer just continue to
work.

3. For failed audio the fallback algorithm should do the same sequence.
4. When starting in lv2 mode, just hide jack/alsa menu.

Correct me if I missed something :)
